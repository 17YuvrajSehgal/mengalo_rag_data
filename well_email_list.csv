I am wondering how long your juices last in the fridge. I'm thinking of trying the 3-day supply but am kind of wanting to order in advance for a longer period of time, i.e. not just doing a 3-day cleanse but a 6- or 9-day cleanse. Can I order all at once and store them?

Additionally, over what amount is your shipping (I'm in Mississauga) free?

Thanks very much!

Invitation to support Respiratory Therapy Week at Peter Lougheed Centre with a gift or donation.,8,2024-09-16 13:40,1,"Dear Local Neighbour,

Peter Lougheed Centre (PLC) has been a proud member of the Northwest community since 1988, providing acute and outpatient care to thousands of Calgarians and Neighbors each year. Throughout the year the Respiratory Services Department works hard to ensure the best care for every patient and visitor.

Each year we celebrate our Registered Respiratory Therapists during our National Respiratory Therapy Week for all their hard work, achievements, and dedication to patient care. This celebration week serves to educate the public about the varied roles and responsibilities of registered respiratory therapists (RRTs) and to raise awareness of the significant contributions made by RRTs across our health care system. It also provides the opportunity help build a positive culture of teamwork, create an engaged workforce, and is a significant resource for the over 200 respiratory therapists working at PLC to boost staff moral and build an internal community, that allows us to continue provide excellent patient care. This year, Respiratory Therapy Week runs from October 20nd to 26th, 2024.

As you may or not be aware, RRTs provide essential care to patients of all ages. From attending countless births to ensure that babies take their first breaths, to taking care of the sickest patients in the intensive care unit. RRTs can be found in almost every area of health care, working as highly trained health professionals dedicated providing the best possible cardio-respiratory care. RRTs use their expertise in assessment and management of respiratory diseases, in-patient and family education, and in the resuscitation and stabilization of critically ill or injured patients. RRTs work in hospitals, in clinics and in the community to help members of your community breathe easier.

We are inviting businesses, vendors, and other community members to support this celebration week by showing recognition for all the amazing work that Registered Respiratory Therapists do for our community. We are asking if you would be willing to spare a small gift or donation of any kind that could be used to support or celebration events. We would be happy to receive a product or non-monetary item from your business that we could include in a gift basket, food items, or gift cards.

The National Business School Conference is seeking a partnership with Well Juicery to include promotional materials in delegate bags for their 2024 event.,8,2024-10-29 9:01,1,"Good morning,

My name is Joaquin Narvaez, and I am one of the Directors of Corporate
Relations for this year's National Business School Conference (NBSC).

I am writing to you concerning a partnership opportunity for this year's
NBSC, taking place from November 14th to 17th, 2024. For over 30 years,
NBSC and the I.H. Asper School of Business have brought over 160 of the top
business student leaders from across Canada to Winnipeg, Manitoba. Since
its inception in 1993, NBSC has been one of the premier business student
conferences in Canada. This event brings together Canada‚Äôs next generation
of business leaders, including Business Student Association Executives.
Throughout the duration of the conference, delegates share, discuss, and
find solutions to challenges concerning their schools and student
engagement. Through successful execution, hard work, and generous partners,
NBSC has developed into one of the most influential conferences of the
academic year. This conference is the perfect opportunity to maximize
exposure and brand awareness among emerging leaders from all over Canada.

The NBSC committee plans to provide all 160 delegates who attend a bag full
of items from various companies. In order to achieve this goal, we are
looking to partner with Well Juicery in the hopes of having your
promotional materials featured in all of the delegate bags. In exchange for
your partnership, we are able to offer you promotional opportunities to
students from across Canada, as well as access to the delegates through the
products you provide. This is an excellent opportunity to showcase your
brand and gain a marketing advantage amongst a vast audience of delegates.

Please find attached a document describing the event in more detail.

We are excited to hear from you soon and appreciate your consideration.
With your support, we can make NBSC 2024 truly memorable.

Best regards,

Joaquin Narvaez.

Hi Veronica,

Apologized for the missing 4 Elixir wellness shots. The 4 Elixir shots are
free therefore it‚Äôs not needed for the cleanse. If you like we can ship out
the 4 elixir shots tomorrow at no cost or alternatively we can provide you
with a discount code you use toward your future orders. Let us know which
option you prefer.

Thank You,
Well Team 
Sincerely, 
Well Juices

Unfortunately your screenshot ‚Äúimage.png‚Äù is all that will display, not the image. 

I didn‚Äôt expect to find it before selecting checkout. I did expect to find it before the place order button. It‚Äôs not visible. I am using iOS 16.7.10 with Safari. I also tried Chrome with same result. Here is my screenshot that differs from yours in several ways. 

I then changed my order to a single 6 pack without a recurring order and on checkout it displays with the discount field. 

Is this an error then that the discount field doesn‚Äôt display for a recurring order? Or is it intentional and no discounts allowed for recurring order? I also see the recurring order is handled through a different checkout process as it displays ‚Äúcheckout.rechargeapps.com‚Äù where the other checkout displays ‚Äúdrinkwell.ca‚Äù. 

Thanks,

I  really enjoy your wellness shots and have by now ordered them multiple times. However, I have now twice received incorrect shipments.

Good Afternoon,

Just messaging in regards to one of your juices I've recently
tried. It was pretty good. The apple, Ginger, cucumber, lemon,
grapefruit.

I think I'm sensitive to fruits that belong in the rose plant
family though, which includes red apple varieties. I'm ok with
Granny Smith green variety thankfully but yea.

Just wondering, I'm assuming the apples you use in this drink
flavour are a red variety?

If so, think I did have a reaction to your drink. And
unfortunately won't be able to buy any of your juices, sadly. As
each flavour, has something I'm intolerance too.. Like spinach,

Ok. Thanks

Just messaging as I recently tried your well Apple, Ginger,
lemon, grapefruit, cucumber drink.. Sadly its the only one I can
have though. As I have a few food intolerances, sensitive to
pollen in carrots and oxylates in beets and spinach. Was just
wondering if you might make a green juice with no spinach
possibly in future, as it sounds good minus the spinach lol..

Or even other varieties.. Possibly green apple, lemon, Ginger,
celery, pineapple, pomegranate, turmeric, cabbage, cranberry,
mango, blueberry, cucumber.. Things I can tolerate lol.

Regardless, appreciate your new convenient, healthier juice
options, and glad I can have 1 at least. Thankful.

"Update on the LCBO strike involving ongoing issues, product availability, and meeting outcomes.",13,2024-07-18 0:00,0,"view email in browser [1] 

 		¬†

 		 [2]

Hi ,

I am taking over communication on the LCBO strike in Kris Barnier‚Äôs
absence.¬†¬†

Kelly and I had an informative meeting today with the CEO and Senior
Management of the LCBO along with Drinks Ontario, Sprits Canada and Tourism
Association of Ontario, who we brought in on our conversation to amplify
our voice.¬†¬†

We continue to raise the ongoing issues with ordering, product availability
delivery and concerns around supply, should the strike continue for the
longer term.¬†¬†

We have established a recurring weekly meeting with the CEO and senior
management moving forward. This will help us highlight the challenges being
experienced by you, our members, and provide examples and push for
solutions.¬†

The Government and LCBO have affirmed that they are allocating their
limited resources toward ensuring restaurants and bars are the top
priority.‚ÄØTheir recent decision to move forward with the opening of 30
stores for licensees and not the public, means their resources are being
focused on our sector and it means that you now have access to greater
supply and wider range of inventory.‚ÄØ¬†¬†
¬†
With regards to the online ordering system, we understand orders are
generally successfully going through although we have also received
messages from members about specific challenges.‚ÄØWe have raised these
concerns with the LCBO. The LCBO contends that the process and system of
fulfillment is improving, and they are seeing increasing numbers of orders
being fulfilled. There will be approximately 600 orders delivered by end of
day today, and 1400 by Monday.¬†
¬†
They also contend product is delivered on average, in 2 ‚Äì 3 days but some
regions may be longer. Please provide feedback on your delivery times.¬†¬†

LCBO has also stated that they have sufficient product and variety for the
time being as they increased inventory prior to the strike.¬†

Out of stock items ordered on the web site are due to their primary
challenge of moving stock to fulfillment areas. Those items will eventually
(hours or days) become available at that fulfillment location.¬†¬†

If the product is not showing as in stock, there is a button at the bottom
of the online ordering portal to check other locations. See the video
tutorial HERE [3].¬†¬†

They recommend licensees utilize all options to access product including
on-line ordering and the trillium supply chain.¬†¬†¬†

OTHER KEY UPDATE ITEMS:

The union and government are back at the negotiating table.‚ÄØThis is
positive but we are still advocating for an LCBO contingency should the
strike go long.¬†¬†
¬†
THROUGH YOUR QUICK RESPONSES TO OUR RECENT MEMBER SURVEY, AND THROUGH YOUR
CALLS, TEXTS, AND EMAILS, THE REAL TIME DATA YOU ARE SHARING WITH US IS
ASSISTING OUR ADVOCACY. THANK YOU.¬†
¬†
We will continue to keep you informed as information becomes available.

Sincerely,

Richard

_The Nutmeg‚Äôs Curse _traces the roots of the current climate crisis to Western colonialism and its joint exploitation of people and the natural environment. Amitav Ghosh tells the story of nutmeg as a parable for the inseparable relationship between humans and the Earth and the colonial perspective that has ultimately led to the crisis people are facing today. Through essays exploring historical events, contemporary inequities, and the threads that follow the past through the present, Ghosh presents a compelling, sharp critique of Western society.

[Mood](https://www.clkmg.com/wellput-io/141587lzhmj7j1/v2-r5247-p141587-c528/Farm2Me///), if you've ever struggled to enjoy cannabis due to the harshness of smoking or vaping, you're not alone. That‚Äôs why these new cannabis gummies caught our eye.

Mood is an online dispensary that has invented a ‚Äújoint within a gummy‚Äù that‚Äôs extremely potent yet federally-legal. Their gummies are formulated to tap into the human body‚Äôs endocannabinoid system.¬†

Although this system was discovered in the 1990‚Äôs, farmers and scientists at Mood were among the first to figure out how to tap into it with cannabis gummies.

I have tried to connect with customer service in several ways and have not been able to speak to anyone. Your office number hangs up, social media is not monitored and emails not responded to.

I need to know if my juice is bad seeing as it was left out over night outside. 

When does the juice expire also?","Oh, I am so sorry to hear about the inconvenience you‚Äôve faced. If your juice was left outside overnight, it might not be safe to consume. Since our products need to be kept refrigerated to maintain their freshness, exposure to external temperatures for an extended period could compromise their quality. For the expiration date, please refer to the date etched on the side of each bottle. If you can't find it, kindly let us know. I'm also escalating this issue so a human representative can provide further assistance and ensure your concerns are addressed promptly.",Alex@drinkwell.ca,allireith@gmail.com,Allison Reith,thread_vvZRPT0mxjCV42xdEamtBhlG,169,50,closed

"Customer is heartbroken about the unavailability of greens juice in Burnaby, BC Costco and wants to know if it will be restocked.",2,2024-07-07 0:00,0,"Hello,

I was so excited a few months ago when I went to my local Costco in
Burnaby, B.C., and found your greens juice in a 1-liter bottle. I bought 15
bottles right away; three weeks later, I went back, and they did not have
any and were not sure when it would be restocked. I have gone back multiple
times since and have now been told it will not be coming back. This news
left me heartbroken, to say the least.

I was introduced to your juices on a recent trip to Calgary, Alberta. I was
blown away by the quality and hooked right away. My favourite is the
greens. I look forward to the day there will be better selection and easy
access in BC. Please tell me I will see your products in BC Costco again. I
am looking forward to hearing from you.","We are very sorry to hear about your experience and disappointment regarding the availability of our greens juice at your local Costco. It‚Äôs wonderful to know that you enjoy our products so much, and we truly appreciate your support and enthusiasm. Unfortunately, our distribution in British Columbia, including Burnaby, is currently limited. While we don't have immediate plans to restock in BC Costco locations, we are always exploring opportunities to expand our reach and bring our products to more customers like you. We value your feedback and hope to provide better access to our juices in the future.

Concerning shipping, I've had issues with orders being delivered to my

your pick-up address, and our shipping address to obtain a door-to-door

the payments and arrange for the necessary shipping arrangements.

Hope all is going amazing.
Saw you have a new line the Hydrator packs available - wish you all were here in Las Vegas, NV!

As we approach the end of the week, I wanted to reach out and see if you have any last-minute freight that needs coverage.
With the market tightening, trucks are in high demand, and capacity is moving fast. The current surge in load volume compared to available trucks has created some challenges, leading to possible delays and increased costs as demand rises.

At TQL, we're available 24/7 to help you navigate these market conditions, ensuring that you have access to reliable options at competitive rates. Whether you need full truckload, LTL, temperature-controlled, or specialized services, our extensive carrier network can help secure a truck, even in these peak times.

Please let me know if you'd like to discuss your needs-I'd be happy to assist in finding the best solutions for you!

Remember those etiquette-worthy kitchen dinner nights of our youth, having great conversations around the dinner table? Now, as graduates and adults, dinners channel the time to throw together a no-stress, all-vibes dinner dedicated to keeping our friends together and family in check, or our little ones happy. The dinners may have transformed, but one tradition that‚Äôs new is our ability to find authentic emerging ingredients to host the most beautifully delicious casual gathering. And summer? It's the perfect time to throw the perfect brat summer night of grand celebrations that dreams are made of.

We hope this newsletter is filled with smart and attainable menus for people who want to spend more time having great conversations around the table than stressing about making an innovative dinner experience. There‚Äôs nothing quite like the quality and flavor of produce bought directly from the maker, made in small batches local in your community. Plus, supporting local agriculture is a win for the environment too ‚Äî so go visit your farmer‚Äôs market.

Inside, you'll find our best dinner party tips and tricks, a favorite list of emerging products, a list of what's in season right now, and products to use to change it up ‚Äîsmall batch, flavorful and ready for you to enjoy.

Happy garden party!

With warm regards, Farm2Me

**grab your fav things, we‚Äôre setting the table**

Certainly! Here's the revised version with corrected punctuation:

Any Farm2Me maker, anywhere in the world, is my culinary challenge (I like to look for the strangest products and produce I can find). It‚Äôs how I engage with the emerging artisans who are putting out their families' traditions in the food they produce and grow. The variety of products I come across, from cultures all over the world, is what makes my dinner party.

I understand that it can feel hard knowing when something is truly small batch and sustainable, but that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre here for.  We want to educate you, so you have our 14 years of context, plus keep you informed on the latest launches and emerging products, so your dinner parties stand out.  The goal is to reach you to weed out the pretty packages stuffed with Kellogg‚Äôs-brand ingredients and keep your guests happy.  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve compiled my tricks to help you navigate the variety of products and greens you‚Äôre about to explore ‚Äî and rethink your approach to your favorite recipes (which can be swapped out with any product, and still taste new).

Savor your recipe and product adventure!  It‚Äôs not the steps of mastering a recipe that counts, it‚Äôs the ingredients you use. And look for the ugliest packaging, produced in the smallest towns, and cleanest ingredient list to help you decide what will taste best.  That‚Äôs 101.  Then search it on [Farm2Me](https://farm2.me) and see if we‚Äôve vetted them on our site.  If not, [submit](https://farm2.me/pages/submit-brand) the product while your grocery shopping and someone from our team will vet in 5 mins or less.

With culinary regards, Farm2Me



**1) EAT WHATS MADE SEASONALLY**

In season caught or grown ingredients are going to have the nutrients you crave - think citrus in summer, raw salads, grilled veggies, cold ice cream and pies, bright colors ‚Äî it makes sense.  Just think about your favorite dishes and find the products that will fit the dish ‚Äî add an herb or a tinned fish you‚Äôve never added to your charcuterie board. 

**2) KEEP IT SIMPLE**

5 mins of cutting or plating is all a plate should take, top a small dish, use a drizzle of olive oil (not a lot), or drip a few drops of a sauce for people to poke at.  That‚Äôs all you need.  Let the flavor of the product shine!  Here‚Äôs some [tinned fish](https://farm2.me/collections/smoked-canned-fish-wholesale) and [olive oils](https://farm2.me/collections/oil-vinegar), [non-alc cocktails](https://farm2.me/collections/non-alcoholic-in-bulk-wholesale-wholesale), [snacks](https://farm2.me/collections/snacks-snacks-highlights-discoveries) and others to use to compliment your table.  The secret to the best dinner parry is to cater to the different tastes of your guests. The more random mixing and matching ‚Äî the better!

**3) BUT LEAVE ROOM FOR SPONTANEITY**

don‚Äôt try to match, instead try to clash plateware colors and napkins, ask random guests to help partake, see how one pattern is different from another, one canned product from another. as you experiment, and get better, you‚Äôll be more confident in switching products and flavors for others, adding new ingredients together. 99% of the time it‚Äôs in the [sauces](https://farm2.me/collections/pantry-sauces-condiments-wholesale) or salt or dressings you use. 

**4) START EARLY**

Sunshine and golden hour sunsets are your time to let the dishes shine, and you have a limited window to execute - so it makes sense to have snacks and cocktails for people to start with , do that!  You‚Äôll thank us.  Get the party started before 5pm, or earlier.

**5) READ ABOUT THE MAKERS**

The farmers and makers have bios on Farm2Me that they curated for you ‚Äî it‚Äôll help you tell their story and steer the direction of conversations throughout the night.  Their stories are so interesting and explain how these products came to be.  So dont think you‚Äôre weird for understanding the backstory of chorizo or chengdu crunch.

**6) ALWAYS BUY SOME FLOWERS**

Get a gift for yourself or your partner - succulents, produce plants w/ roots, planters, and cut flowers count.  Go for the roots, they‚Äôll last longer than 1 dinner! Changing up your flowers with seasonal flowers will keep you present in your quest for the perfect vibe.

**7) IN SEASON SUMMER PRODUCE**

Want you to do some math work ‚Äî go to farmers market and ask for ‚Äúseconds‚Äù (read: products with bruises) and take home product for 75% off or sometimes free.  $2.99/LB becomes $0.99/LB.  Now go to the grocery store and compare the price of that ‚ÄúOrganic‚Äù Kale.  Thank us later! Bonus: send us what you make and tag us on our [Instagram](http://instagram.com/Farm2Me).

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to introduce you to the VIU Mariners women's soccer team and explore potential sponsorship opportunities for the upcoming 2024 season. Our team has been training rigorously to build on the achievements of last year, and we are eagerly anticipating our home opener on September 7th.

This season, our ambitious goal is to qualify for the 2024 CCAA Women‚Äôs Soccer National Championships, which will be hosted by Capilano University in early November in Squamish, BC. Competing against strong PACWEST rivals, we believe that with your support, our team can reach new heights. Your sponsorship would provide essential resources, allowing our athletes to concentrate on their training and perform at their best.

Sponsoring a women's university soccer team is an incredible opportunity to make a positive impact on young athletes and the community. It helps promote gender equality in sports, inspires the next generation of female athletes, and fosters a sense of pride and unity. Your support would not only benefit the team but also enhance your company's visibility and reputation among students, alumni, and the wider community.

We hope you will consider joining us as a sponsor for the 2024 season. Below are some exciting partnership opportunities available:
Partnership Opportunities:
League Game Day Sponsor - $1,000
Game day signage opportunities on the day of sponsorship
Pre-game, half-time, and in-play activation opportunities
Social media mentions leading up to game day
Announcer recognition on game day
Four 2024/25 season passes for all Mariners soccer, volleyball, and basketball home games

Game Day Signage - $500
Your logo promoted through social media and on the video scoreboard at home league games throughout the season
Two 2024/25 season passes for all Mariners soccer, volleyball, and basketball home games
For more information on supporting our Mariners or to make a gift, please contact Dave Forrester at david.forrester@viu.ca <mailto:david.forrester@viu.ca> or 250.740.6431.


Thank you for considering this opportunity to support our team. We look forward to the possibility of partnering with you for an exciting and successful season.

We're particularly interested in your Beverage line up. Our target market values affordability, so we're looking for products at competitive prices without compromising on quality.

I have to share with you what a poor experience I am having with my first order of Well Juices. If I would have known that getting a delivery was this difficult I would have picked them up at Safeway.

On your website, it says that orders will be delivered 24-48 hours after ordering. I understand that there is no shipping on Saturday or Sunday but I figured that since I placed the order Friday afternoon that I could reasonably assume I would have my order by end of day Tuesday.

I have received so many confirmations that my order is on the way, then part of it is , then all of it is, then now I just received a message that it wont be here until end if day Wednesday. I still don‚Äôt know if that is some of my order, all of my order or none of my order.

I needed this order for an important breakfast meeting tomorrow morning. Having it delivered at end of day Wednesday, after placing my order on Friday is simply unacceptable. This order is completely useless to me at this point. Can you let me know what my options are at this point? I can be reached by email or you can call me at 403-606-9181. Thanks,
","I'm truly sorry to hear about the difficulties you're experiencing with your first Well Juices order.

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Serena and I am body contouring esthetician at SP Contour, where we specialize in body contouring and wellness services. I am reaching out to explore a potential collaboration that I believe could greatly benefit both of our businesses.

As you know, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is crucial for achieving optimal results in body contouring. Our clients are always looking for ways to enhance their health and wellness journeys, and I believe that integrating your juicing products into our services could provide significant value.

### Collaboration Benefits:
1. **Enhanced Client Experience:** By offering your fresh and nutritious juices, we can provide our clients with a holistic approach to their wellness. This combination of body contouring and healthy juicing can maximize their results and overall satisfaction.

2. **Cross-Promotion Opportunities:** We can feature your products in our wellness programs and marketing materials, allowing both of us to reach a broader audience. Our clients would be introduced to your brand, while you would gain exposure to individuals invested in improving their health and appearance.

3. **Workshops and Events:** We could organize joint workshops or health events that focus on the benefits of body contouring and healthy nutrition. This interactive approach can engage our clientele and promote both brands effectively.

4. **Exclusive Offers:** We could create exclusive packages or discounts for our clients who purchase your juices, encouraging them to incorporate your products into their routines.

Our clients are increasingly seeking ways to complement their body contouring results with healthy eating habits, making your juicing products a perfect fit. I am confident that this partnership would enhance our clients' experiences and drive business for both of us.

I would love to discuss this collaboration further and explore how we can work together. Please let me know a convenient time for you to connect.

Thank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to the possibility of collaborating to promote wellness and healthy living.","Thank you for your interest in collaborating with Well Juicery.

I never did hear anything back when I sent my second email??

They said that they wanted my order number which I did give them in the first email and then I gave it again in my second email. I just wanted to know as far as I could see. It has not updated anything since Tuesday when I looked at tracking.

I ordered it on Friday which I realise it‚Äôs the weekend. But  in the past, I usually get it within two days sometimes three.

I have ordered from you guys in the past with no issues. This is my third time ordering with you. 

My order number is #31029

If you could give me some sort of update of what is going on if it‚Äôs on its way, no problem!

 Hey! If I order a cleanse today (Sunday) and I‚Äôm in Ontario, how long will
it take to reach me? Which cleanse would you recommend for colon
cancer/chemotherapy. I am not new to fasting, and have done water fasts and
the prolon program so I believe I could easily do this too.","If you order a cleanse today (Sunday) and you‚Äôre in Ontario, it will be shipped out on Monday. Delivery typically takes 1-3 business days, so you can expect it to arrive within that timeframe.

Regarding a cleanse recommendation for colon cancer/chemotherapy, we always advise consulting with your medical professional before starting any cleanse, especially given your condition. That said, our cleanses are designed to support overall health and wellness by providing a powerful dose of vitamins, minerals, and enzymes which may be beneficial. We recommend choosing the cleanse that aligns best with your dietary preferences and any guidance from your healthcare provider.

My name is Nicole, I'm excited to present a unique opportunity to partner with three incredible event series for 2025: Big Bounce Run, Muddy Kids, and Muddy Princess. These events offer fun, challenging, and family-friendly experiences that have become staples for fitness enthusiasts and adventurers across the country.

Big Bounce Run, The largest inflatable obstacle course in the USA, attracting a diverse crowd from competitive runners to families looking for a fun day out. With events in major cities, this is a great platform to reach an engaged and active audience.

Muddy Kids, A 1.5-2.2 mile adventure designed for families with kids aged 5-15, promoting teamwork, physical activity, and family bonding. Sponsorship offers your brand exposure to health-conscious families in a fun, non-competitive environment.

Muddy Princess, A women-only mud run that encourages empowerment and camaraderie, celebrating women of all fitness levels. It's an ideal event for brands looking to engage with an audience focused on health, fitness, and self-confidence.

I've attached individual information decks for your viewing pleasure;

Hi ,

LCBO AND OPSEU REACH TENTATIVE DEAL¬†

Restaurants Canada congratulates the LCBO and Ontario Public Service
Employees Union¬†(OPSEU) in reaching a tentative agreement to end the
strike. The 15-day strike created a challenging situation for our industry,
and we are thankful the two sides could reach a tentative agreement.

¬†

We are grateful to Premier Doug Ford and his government, LCBO management,
and the LCBO staff for their tireless efforts to prioritize restaurants and
bars throughout the strike - by allocating limited resources to our sector.
The prioritization helped reduce the negative impacts of the strike on
restaurants and bars during our summer peak season.

¬†

‚ÄúOur operators are breathing a sigh of relief,‚Äù said Kelly Higginson,
President & CEO, Restaurants Canada. ‚ÄúThank you to our members in Ontario
for supporting us with feedback and data during the labour dispute. The
information shared was essential in our advocacy efforts. It was great to
see our restaurant community come together. I wish all members a prosperous
remainder of the summer.‚Äù

¬†

THE STRIKE WILL OFFICIALLY CONCLUDE ON JULY 22 AT 12:01 A.M., AND STORES
ARE SCHEDULED TO REOPEN ON TUESDAY, JULY 23. THE LCBO IS CURRENTLY
PREPARING TO RESUME OPERATIONS SMOOTHLY, WITH MORE DETAILS TO FOLLOW
SHORTLY.

Please feel free to reach out to me directly with any questions or
concerns.

¬†

Sincerely,

Richard

"Tim Clark, representing Squish Juicery, reached out to discuss the potential sale of Squish Juicery due to personal and family tragedies impacting the owners.",11,2024-08-27 22:52,0,"Hi,

My name is Tim Clark, representing Squish Juicery as a consultant, to share with you a successful and sadden story. We ask you please keep this information confidential.
As a fellow juicer I do not need to sell you the amazing benefits cold pressed juice has to offer or the benefits from a successful brand, extensive wholesale line, and of course incredible recipes.

I can, however, tell you about Squish Juicery, which opened in December of 2018, with a set plan of what the business was going to look like, what they were going to provide as services and what a 5-year plan filled with goals and dreams of Squish Juicery stores all over the lower mainland looked like.

Then came a global pandemic at the start of year 2 and they had to pivot, grow, adapt, learn, challenge themselves in ways never imagined, set new goals, and work harder than anyone could imagine keeping their doors open and staying in business.

Squish Juicery consistently doubled their sales year after year, and it was on track to break a million dollars in sales as in year four they did to $800,000 in sales with no accounts receivable.

The launch of their wholesale line was the growth acceleration they needed to take them over the top.  Proudly carried in over 60 locations across the lower mainland including:  Whole Foods Market locations (including the island), IGA stores, Fresh St. Markets, and Pomme Natural Market locations. Squish's next goal was to build out a large-scale production facility and scale the business even further, excited for the next growth chapter for Squish.

The Squish family grew by one, a year ago, welcoming a beautiful little girl to the family.  Unfortunately, Jessica and Callan, the owners of Squish, were then struck with very heartbreaking tragedies. Jessica's mother was diagnosed with a devastating chronic illness and is basically house bound, then Jessica's father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and if that was not enough Callans's mother was also diagnosed with terminal cancer.   Jessica and Callan are both going to lose their parents this year.

This has just been too much for them. They no longer have the capacity to own and operate Squish Juicery and unfortunately find themselves in the position to have to sell.

With this said, if you are at all interested in furthering a discussion on how you could purchase Squish Juicery I would be pleased to chat with you. We ask you to keep this confidential, thank you and I look forward to hearing from you.",,None,tim@tciconsulting.ca,Tim Clark,thread_M37PIPxwoQwFuxdk8AaJVYsQ,591,50,closed

Jessica Raynor from Accessible Housing is requesting a donation for a silent auction at their Dinner For Doors fundraising event.,7,2024-07-23 0:00,1,"Hello Well Juicery,

Accessible Housing, a non-profit organization, is requesting donations for silent auction items to help raise funds for those with limited mobility. The silent auction will be held during Dinner For Door fundraising event, on October 17, 2024, at Silver Springs Golf Course. Last year's Dinner For Doors event successfully raised over $10,000. A donation from Well Juicery, whether it be a service, gift certificate, or any other item, would greatly assist in raising essential funds for Accessible Housing's programs.

This year marks a significant milestone for our organization, Accessible Housing proudly celebrates our 50th anniversary!  A remarkable journey that began in 1974, when a group of young individuals with limited mobility that wished to live in community founded our organization. In 1976, Calgary's first shared living residence, Fourth Dimension (4-D) was built. This barrier-free group home housed 12 individuals and marked the beginning of a journey towards more inclusive housing solutions. At this year's Dinner for Door, we acknowledge the progress made and the dedication of our founders. Join us as we celebrate 50 years of supporting people with limited mobility, including those who use wheelchairs, walkers, and canes, often overcoming homelessness or life-changing accidents to find accessible and affordable homes.

What will you receive? Over 125 guests will see your logo which will be featured on our presentation throughout the night, as well as on the item bidding info. If you're able to donate a silent auction item, please complete the Silent Auction Form attached and send it back to me, along with your logo if you would like recognition of your donation.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions. We greatly appreciate the support!

I look forward to hearing from you.

[Omnivore](https://farm2.me/collections/omnivore-wholesale) was founded by Angelo Garro at the end of 2013, thanks to the enthusiastic support of thousands of **Kickstarter** contributors and the San Francisco food community.¬†

Known for his role in Michael Pollan‚Äôs book ‚Äú**The Omnivore‚Äôs Dilemma**‚Äù, Angelo is a master blacksmith by trade and a passionate hunter, forager, cook and Slow Food icon.

While foraging as a child in Sicily, he learned the wonder of herbs like the wild fennel that grew around his childhood home, and spices like the chili peppers his grandmother hung to dry in her kitchen‚Äîwhen mixed with salt, they give character to any food and make cooking simple. This inspired the launch of [Omnivore‚Äôs](https://farm2.me/collections/omnivore-wholesale) first product [**Omnivore SALT**](https://farm2.me/collections/omnivore-wholesale/products/omnivore-salt-2-oz-tin), a spiced salt blend defined by Alice Waters as ‚Äúindispensable‚Äù, and drew us to experiment with new salt blends ([**Limone**](https://farm2.me/collections/omnivore-wholesale/products/omnivore-limone-2-oz-tin)**, **[**Porcini**](https://farm2.me/collections/omnivore-wholesale/products/omnivore-porcini-2-oz-tin)** **and [**Tartufo**](https://farm2.me/collections/omnivore-wholesale/products/omnivore-tartufo-2-oz-tin), hot sauces (**Vulcano- ****Classic **and** ****Ginger**) and¬†Omnivore‚Äôs cooking base¬†([**Sicilia**](https://farm2.me/collections/omnivore-wholesale/products/omnivore-sicilia)) and Condiment and Spread, **Pepata**.

Remember those carefree Friday nights of our youth, brimming with the promise of weekend adventures? Now, as graduates / adults, Fridays signal the start of two days dedicated to keeping our mental & physical health in check, or our little ones entertained. The weekends may have transformed, but one tradition that remains is our weekly trip to the farmers market. And summer? It's the perfect time to revel in the bounty of fresh, local produce.

We hope this newsletter encourages you to make regular visits to your local farmers market. There‚Äôs nothing quite like the quality and flavor of produce bought directly from the farmers in your community. Plus, supporting local agriculture is a win for the environment too.

Inside, you'll find our best farmers market tips and tricks, a favorite recipe using summer's peak tomatoes or greens, a list of what's in season right now, and products to use to change it up ‚Äîsmall batch, ripe and ready for you to enjoy.

Happy market shopping!

With warm regards, Farm2Me

[Cabi](https://farm2.me/collections/cabi-wholesale-products)¬† products are¬†simple fermented Japanese condiments. It starts with a piece of mold (see: Cabi name) and¬†[Cabi](https://farm2.me/collections/cabi-wholesale-products) hopes it spreads like a culture; the desire to share easy and traditional Japanese home cooking - soy sauce, dashi, yuzu, mirin, and more.

[Cabi](https://farm2.me/collections/cabi-wholesale-products)¬†heard it a thousand times before: ‚Äúwe really want to cook Japanese food, but what the hell is Mirin? And what does Dashi look like? How many types of miso are there?‚Äù. Well,¬†Cabi is here to tell you all about it if you let them.

Always small batch, some of the best in the country. [Cabi Foods](https://farm2.me/collections/cabi-wholesale-products) is a condiment brand that aims to make Japanese home cooking more accessible to people of all cooking levels. The company's founders, Eri Miyagi and Miki Nomura, believe that food is a universal language that should be shared and taught, and that Japanese flavors can be incorporated into any dish. [Cabi's](https://farm2.me/collections/cabi-wholesale-products) products are designed to be easy to use and versatile, and the founders encourage people to enjoy the flavors without feeling like they need to cook. [Cabi's](https://farm2.me/collections/cabi-wholesale-products) initial product line includes three all-natural seasonings made in Japan: [sweet yuzu vinegar](https://farm2.me/collections/cabi-wholesale-products/products/cabi-sweet-yuzu-vinegar), [umami dashi soy sauce](https://farm2.me/collections/cabi-wholesale-products/products/cabi-umami-dashi-soy-sauce-wholesale), and [zesty sansho peppercorn miso](https://farm2.me/collections/cabi-wholesale-products/products/cabi-zesty-sansho-peppercorn-miso-wholesale).

**grab your fav bag, we‚Äôre going shopping**

Any farmers market, anywhere in the world, is my culinary paradise (especially if there are veggies I‚Äôve never seen). It's where I connect directly with the dedicated artisans who grow and produce our food, and the variety of produce by  simply going to different markets different days/weekends, is unmatched.

I understand that it can feel a bit daunting, despite its charm. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve compiled my tricks to help you navigate the variety of fresh produce and eggs you‚Äôre about to explore ‚Äî and rethink your approach to your favorite recipes (which can be swapped out with any produce, and still taste the same ‚Äî with new nutrients).

Savor your market adventure!  And look for the strangest names of varieties (varietals).

With culinary regards, Farm2Me



**1) EAT WHATS IN SEASON**

In season ingredients can be swapped out for eachother or combined - think pasta sauce or salad, stir fry, pizza toppings, pies, ice cream toppings, etc.  Just throw in your same sauce or sizzle in your same dressing. 

**2) KEEP IT SIMPLE**

30 seconds in a hot water bath to blanch, drizzled raw with dressing, stir fry for 1 minute or 2.  That‚Äôs all you need.  Let the flavor of the ingredient shine!  Here‚Äôs some [sauces](https://farm2.me/collections/pantry-sauces-condiments-wholesale) and [spices](https://farm2.me/collections/produce-herbs-spices-wholesale-bulk), [oils](https://farm2.me/collections/oil-vinegar), [dressings](https://farm2.me/search?q=salad+dressing) and others to use to compliment the high quality flavor.  The secret to the best restaurants is in the quality of the ingredients & sauces/spicings. They use Farm2Me - that‚Äôs all!

**3) BUT LEAVE ROOM FOR SPONTANEITY**

give yourself 1 hour to be spontaneous, poke around, ask questions, see how one market is different from another, one farm from another. as you experiment, and get better, you‚Äôll be more confident in switching ingredients for others, adding new ingredients together. 99% of the time it‚Äôs in the [sauces](https://farm2.me/collections/pantry-sauces-condiments-wholesale) or salt or dressings you use.

**4) GO EARLY**

These are small farms, they are selling to 200 customers, and have limited supply of the rarest produce - so if it makes sense to grab your coffee or iced tea at market, do that! You‚Äôll thank us.  Get there before noon, or early for night markets  

**5) CHAT WITH VENDORS**

The farmers and employees are more excited to talk to people who ask questions about ingredient sourcing and the strange varietals of produce, than how to prep a tomato.  So don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre weird for asking questions about that odd Tatso Leaves or a strange looking mushroom in front of you.

**6) ALWAYS BUY SOME FLOWERS**

Get a gift for yourself or your partner - succulents, produce plants w/ roots, planters, and cut flowers count.  Go for the roots, they‚Äôll last longer! Changing up your flowers with seasonal flowers will keep you present in your quest for inner peace.

**7) IN SEASON SUMMER PRODUCE**

Want you to do some homework for us ‚Äî go to the market and take photos of 5 strange varieties of cheese, produce, fruit, kombucha flavor, iced tea and email it to us.  Bonus: send us what you do with it here or tag us on our [Instagram](http://instagram.com/Farm2Me).

Re: A shipment from order #30240 is on the way Aug 13

I checked when this was shipped it was last Tuesday Aug 13th at 10am, 
via Purolator.

Even by Friday Aug 16th the juice would be questionable as it had been 
warmed.

Then the Pharmacy iCurae closed at Friday 5pm for the weekend, opening 
today. That means the order was 6 days from shipment as of today.

As such, I have decided to not pick up this order, as it will not be the 
quality I was expecting to receive from Well.ca.","I'm truly sorry to hear about your unpleasant experience with the recent shipment of your order #30240.

Tahjai from Loft 11 Management is seeking sponsorship for cold-pressed juices or cleanse kits for a men's mental health event.,8,2024-06-24 0:00,1,"Hi there,

Allow me to introduce myself ‚Äì I'm Tahjai Grose-Gordon, the co-founder of a
dynamic Influencer/Creative Management and PR Agency based in the vibrant
city of Toronto, Ontario. At Loft 11, we take pride in representing a
curated selection of the city's most influential and visionary individuals.

I'm reaching out today with an exciting proposition. One of our
clients; Troy Crossfield, is the CEO of Crossfield House Productions
<https://www.crossfieldhouseproductions.com/>, a passionate men's mental
health advocate and influencer who founded a non-profit organization,
titled *Iron Sharpens Iron.  *This brand fosters a community of men who
convene on the first Friday of every month, in a safe space to seek
community, provide a space to be vulnerable and break barriers.

Iron Sharpens Iron has previously collaborated with the Toronto Raptors,
The City of Toronto and local community health centres to continue this
serious but often overlooked topic.
Recently, we collaborated with  F45 Fitness
<https://f45training.com/ca/studio/parkwoods/> for a Men's Mental Health
event that will leave a lasting impression taking place on July 5th.

We would like to invite Well Juicery to sponsor cold-pressed juices
and/or cleanse
kits for approx 40-50 men at our event.  We believe that Well Juicery has
an array of nutritious beverages which will align perfectly with our
message of holistic well-being. Your commitment to promoting healthy living
and wellness resonates deeply with us.

In return for your sponsorship, we will ensure Well Juicery receives
acknowledgment in all of our promotional materials, including mentions on
our social media platforms, reaching a largely anticipated audience as well
as social media coverage the day of the event.

We believe that this partnership will showcase the commitment that Well
Juicery has to supporting important causes in the community. I am available
to discuss this opportunity in detail in a brief call and happy to
accommodate your availability.

Looking forward to connecting with you!


Warmest regards,

Rose Amabelle Mendoza from Ted Rogers Finance Society is requesting sponsorship of 100 juices for the Battle on Bay conference in January 2025.,8,2024-08-19 12:00,1,"Hello,

Hope you are staying safe and well. My name is Rose and I am contacting you
on behalf of the Ted Rogers Finance Society (TRFS), a finance course union
that oversees events for over 13,000 students at the Ted Rogers School of
Management.

The reason I'm reaching out is for our biggest event of the year, Battle on
Bay, a 3-day case conference which will be held on January 9 to 11, 2025 in
Downtown Toronto. The conference attracts over 60 senior university student
delegates from 15+ universities across Canada, split into teams of 4. Each
year, we welcome teams of driven and passionate individuals who seek to put
their knowledge and skills to the test by participating in cutting 2
separate cases, a main case and a crisis case. Additionally, the conference
offers students the chance to learn more by attending workshops, listening
to keynote speakers, and participating in networking events.

The reason why I am reaching out to your company is that we would love our
visiting alumni, students, and industry representatives to enjoy your
juices and be showcased at our 18th annual conference. Students can enjoy
your products once they receive their delegate bags. We are requesting your
support by sponsoring us with 100 juices for the event. We are also open to
discussing other options on how you can support the conference (i.e.
coupons, giveaways with one of your products).

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I look forward to
hearing from you!

Best,

[Granny Squibb‚Äôs](https://farm2.me/collections/granny-squibbs-organic-iced-tea-wholesale) Iced Tea‚Äôs Granny said it all began one hot August day in the early 1930‚Äôs. [Granny Squibb◊≥s Iced Tea‚Äôs](https://farm2.me/collections/granny-squibbs-organic-iced-tea-wholesale) grandparents, Sally and George Squibb, and their two sons were spending the summer in a new house they had built overlooking Narragansett Bay in Saunderstown, Rhode Island. The weather was hotter than ever. Not even the sea breezes could keep them cool. Granny remembered a recipe that had been given to her years earlier by her mother-in-law for cold tea, still a novelty in those days. She brewed black tea and fresh mint, squeezed juice from lemons, added sugar and quickly chilled it. Granny said it was amazingly refreshing and thirst quenching, but best of all, it was ‚Äúastonishingly delicious‚Äù! She delighted in sharing the recipe, and it spread quickly throughout the community where the home-brew has been a summer tradition enjoyed by generations to this day. Thus [Granny Squibb‚Äôs Iced Tea](https://farm2.me/collections/granny-squibbs-organic-iced-tea-wholesale) recipe was born.

Granny was ahead of her time and eager to try anything new. She believed in living well and taking advantage of the best life has to offer. She encouraged me try everything and to give it my best shot. ‚ÄúNever say never‚Äù, she said over and over again. Granny wouldn‚Äôt have thought twice about taking on Coke¬Æ and Pepsi¬Æ, and it‚Äôs that spirit of hers which has been the inspiration for founding The [Granny Squibb ](https://farm2.me/collections/granny-squibbs-organic-iced-tea-wholesale)Company.

**Decentralization of Big Food**

Big Food is ConAgra (a monopoly of Grocery & Agriculture) and they control nearly 99.5% of the food you eat - regardless of what supermarket  you shop.  

Earlier this month, we explored how lackluster total shareholder returns (TSRs) can force transformational change in Expect Big Change in Big Food. Now we explore some historical context and the corporate strategy megatrend we believe guides board-level decision-making. General Mills and Conagra reported quarterly earnings a few weeks ago. The big takeaway was that consumers remain in a Big Food coma after 2-3 years of multi-decade-high COVID-driven ‚Äúat-home‚Äù consumption growth. Consumers are now pushing back on price increases, and retailers are investing more in their private label programs. Big Food is back to losing market share again following its short-lived outperformance during the pandemic. Predictably, these factors are forcing Big Food companies to promote and advertise more heavily this summer to improve consumer receptivity to their flagship brands ahead of the Back-to-School season.

However, we believe the COVID era will likely prove a temporary distraction from the corporate strategy megatrend that had been guiding these companies‚Äô actions before this black swan event. In the years and decades before the pandemic, most Big Food companies had been hard at work whittling their portfolios into leaner, more agile, mega/category-specific businesses. This ""Great De-Conglomeration"" involved unwinding what corporate conglomeration had done to the food sector 50+ years ago. The conglomerate era of the 1950-1970s favored the creation of large diversified ""holding"" or ""portfolio"" companies, under the theory that owning multiple uncorrelated cash flow streams would generate steadier, more predictable returns for shareholders through economic cycles. However, the increased complexity and management hubris ultimately led to relatively lackluster organic TSRs and value-destructive M&A, prompting a shift towards decentralization.

In Big Food and Big CPG broadly, decentralization remains an ongoing process. General Mills and Conagra offer interesting examples of this trend, having diversified their portfolios extensively before focusing back on core operations. For instance, General Mills divested its toys and fashion units, and in recent years expanded into pet food with acquisitions of Blue Buffalo and others. Conagra shed most of its non-core assets and reoriented towards a brand- and marketing-oriented CPG company. Despite years of simplification, challenges remain, as seen with Conagra's $100 million lawsuit related to lead paint liabilities. The big strategy question for Big Food is where diversification starts and ends now, as managing large portfolios of brands and business units across disparate categories and channels remains complex. This ongoing process highlights the necessity for Big Food to focus on fewer, bigger things to stay competitive in an evolving market.

when I sat down to think about who next to feature in our summer spotlight series, 250+ organic berry farms that sell the best summer berries immediately came to mind. why? because their commitment to taste, dedication to the highest non-pesticide growing practices, hard work their farmers do everyday to support the movement, crop rotations, and the the planet are what summer bounty is all about. they radiate farm2me and amplify our mission throughout their [work](https://farm2.me/pages/local-organic-berry-farms-near-me), [community events](https://farm2.me/pages/local-organic-berry-farms-near-me), and [farm stores](https://farm2.me/pages/local-organic-berry-farms-near-me), that makes it look effortless, but is not, and it‚Äôs what draws us all to them ‚Äî now let‚Äôs go berry picking (and not just any berries ‚Äî the best of summer, organic berries) .  lwe can do all the research and sourcing to find new emerging products, but the only way to really appreciate this movement is to visit the farms, and networks of farm stores, to test sustainability practices and show us how practical this movement is.  they also carry emerging brands they find through our [wholesale marketplace](https://farm2.me) and [social ](http://instagram.com/Farm2Me)channels IRL.  and there is nothing better than spending a day on the farm, grabbing a drink, having a meal, and supporting local businesses in the countryside!  #bratsummer

born out of a love for local food systems, transparency, innovation, and accessibility, these farmers have amassed a hyper quality product, and a devoted following on instagram thanks to their affordable, open, and enormous passion for the movement. their focus on [education](https://farm2.me/pages/local-organic-berry-farms-near-me), [seasonality](https://farm2.me/pages/local-organic-berry-farms-near-me), [hyper local](https://farm2.me/pages/local-organic-berry-farms-near-me) sourcing, [diverse berry varietals & quality](https://farm2.me/pages/local-organic-berry-farms-near-me), is constantly pushing the limits year after year, and their farms feature the perfect balance of activities, live music, local CPG products, artists, and regional dishes that complement their mission.¬†

--------------------
**Decentralization of Big Food**

Big Food is ConAgra (a monopoly of Grocery & Agriculture) and they control nearly 99.5% of the food you eat - regardless of what supermarket  you shop.  

Earlier this month, we explored how lackluster total shareholder returns (TSRs) can force transformational change in Expect Big Change in Big Food. Now we explore some historical context and the corporate strategy megatrend we believe guides board-level decision-making. General Mills and Conagra reported quarterly earnings a few weeks ago. The big takeaway was that consumers remain in a Big Food coma after 2-3 years of multi-decade-high COVID-driven ‚Äúat-home‚Äù consumption growth. Consumers are now pushing back on price increases, and retailers are investing more in their private label programs. Big Food is back to losing market share again following its short-lived outperformance during the pandemic. Predictably, these factors are forcing Big Food companies to promote and advertise more heavily this summer to improve consumer receptivity to their flagship brands ahead of the Back-to-School season.

However, we believe the COVID era will likely prove a temporary distraction from the corporate strategy megatrend that had been guiding these companies‚Äô actions before this black swan event. In the years and decades before the pandemic, most Big Food companies had been hard at work whittling their portfolios into leaner, more agile, mega/category-specific businesses. This ""Great De-Conglomeration"" involved unwinding what corporate conglomeration had done to the food sector 50+ years ago. The conglomerate era of the 1950-1970s favored the creation of large diversified ""holding"" or ""portfolio"" companies, under the theory that owning multiple uncorrelated cash flow streams would generate steadier, more predictable returns for shareholders through economic cycles. However, the increased complexity and management hubris ultimately led to relatively lackluster organic TSRs and value-destructive M&A, prompting a shift towards decentralization.

In Big Food and Big CPG broadly, decentralization remains an ongoing process. General Mills and Conagra offer interesting examples of this trend, having diversified their portfolios extensively before focusing back on core operations. For instance, General Mills divested its toys and fashion units, and in recent years expanded into pet food with acquisitions of Blue Buffalo and others. Conagra shed most of its non-core assets and reoriented towards a brand- and marketing-oriented CPG company. Despite years of simplification, challenges remain, as seen with Conagra's $100 million lawsuit related to lead paint liabilities. The big strategy question for Big Food is where diversification starts and ends now, as managing large portfolios of brands and business units across disparate categories and channels remains complex. This ongoing process highlights the necessity for Big Food to focus on fewer, bigger things to stay competitive in an evolving market.

**How to read the label on $30 Olive Oil**

### Olive oil is the new fancy kid. But ever wonder what makes the difference in a high end olive oil?  (Don‚Äôt get greenwashed)

There are two types of shoppers in 2024.

One is on social finding brands through popularity, reaching for recognizable squeeze bottles or fancy glassware labels. The other is wondering why these bottles are better when they‚Äôre $40 and found at every grocery and specialty store in the country.  We‚Äôre on the latter side! 

That‚Äôs right! It‚Äôs impossible for an olive oil to be in every grocery store in the country and be a quality product, unless they tell you the 1,000s of small batch farms each bottle is bottled in ‚Äî otherwise it‚Äôs mass produced, consolidated, handled by multiple drivers, packers, unpackers, bottlers, producers, might even travel long distances between the farm, distributor, bottler, warehouse, and the grocery stores, or worse ‚Äî processed, over processed, made of cheap olive, lin large batches, and upsold to you with enormous margins (think: $5 olive oil for $20 or $10 olive oil for $40.

Whichever one you are, you‚Äôve probably seen some fancy terms thrown around to get people part with their money. Cold pressed and extra virgin. Early harvest, late harvest. High polyphenol count. High on bio-available antioxidants‚Ä¶

We run through the most important terms you‚Äôll find olive oil labels and why they matter.

There‚Äôs a brutal thunderstorm ripping through CT right now,  so hope you‚Äôre just sitting around for something to read like us.

# What matters on a label

Let‚Äôs start with the basics. Olive oil without any of the other labels simply refers to oil that has been extracted from the olive fruit. This doesn‚Äôt tell you much about how the oil was extracted or the quality. More on that later.

In general, the tell of a high-quality bottle of olive oil is the amount of information you‚Äôll find on the label. As with wines or coffees, quantity is an indication of quality when it comes to the amount of details the producer is bothered to add. One could even say‚Ä¶. more is more. Think: can you google a farm name or is it just a city, state or country?  You need to know the farmer(s) so you can google them and see their reviews / audits online ‚Äî better yet, visit them when you‚Äôre in town. üôÉ

### Origin, Freshness, and Bottling

Olive oil is mainly a mediterranean thing, with Spain, Greece, and Italy being the top producers, followed by other countries in Southern Europe & North Africa, like Tunisia, Portugal, and Turkey. Most of the production in the US is from California, Texas, or Georgia - which is now producing some great olive oils.  We at Farm2Me sell Spanish Olive Oil in Spain, Greek Olive Oil in Greece, and American in America. Why? Because you can buy it here, and it‚Äôs better for the environment.  Also, we limit which Olive Oil ‚Äúmakers‚Äù we sell‚Ä¶ you won‚Äôt find mass produced non-transparent olive oil here.  Not just because we want to stop you, but rather we want you to be able to know the difference - the choice to choose rather than being forced into a black hole of a market without any choice from mass produced $40 bottles.  Read on‚Ä¶ 

In general, smaller productions produce better quality than big industrial producers and single origin brings more character to the taste of an oil than blends simply by the fact that it is specific to a region or producer. For example, oils from Spain tend to be larger production (they‚Äôre one of the biggest mass producer regions in the world), oils from Italy are known to have a grassier taste, and oils from Greece often have a peppery undertone (think dry sun heat causing the olives to be stronger in taste).

You also want to check the bottle for a best by date - while olive oil holds pretty well, anything with a use by date over 18 months of bottling should raise a brow.

These are not the most important things to look at ‚Äî but good to know.

### Harvest Time

Around the mediterranean, harvesting can happen anytime between October (early) and February (late) and then they were harvested matters for a lot of things.

Early harvest (Oct-Nov) tends to give smaller yields using less ripe olives. These olives are not fully ripened, so they are still green or starting to change color. The flavor is more intense - the pepperiness or grassy-ness is more intense, it tends to be more bitter, and in general has a more complex flavor profile. They are also known to have more of the healthy-stuff - antioxidants and popolyphenols.

Late harvest (Dec-Feb) tends to be milder, fruitier, and smoother. It can have slighly lower polyphenol count because the olives were more ripe when they were harvested but it still maintains a lot of the health benefits for olive oil in general.

Again, this is more fact that how to identify the difference in small batch quality.

### How it was Manufacturered

Most of the terms we‚Äôre used to seeing on labels refers to how the oil was manufactured. Phrases like [Cold Pressed](https://farm2.me/collections/olive-oil-wholesale), [First Pressed](https://farm2.me/collections/olive-oil-wholesale), [Extra Virgin ](https://farm2.me/collections/olive-oil-wholesale)all refer to how the oil was extracted and at which temperatures.

The amount of processing matters because the things that manufacturers do to prolong shelf life - heating, filtering, adding chemicals - also ruins the quality of the olive oil by removing a lot of the flavor and reducing the health benefits. The more it is processed, the more it is stripped of the good stuff and left with the bad stuff. Boo! We want it to be Cold Pressed and we want it to be Extra Virgin.

[Temecula Olive Oil ](https://farm2.me/collections/olive-oil-wholesale)still stone grinds the olives - think like 2 disks of stone grinding on top of each other.  Hand cranked.  You‚Äôll taste the difference ‚Äî don‚Äôt need more than a few drops to get the flavor in your salad ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt cook with these olive oils (unless you‚Äôre a billionaire, and in any case you would ruin the flavour once heated).

### The Characteristics of the Oil

When we start getting fancy, we‚Äôll also see some claims about the specific characteristics of the oil itself, which of course is a direct result of everything we‚Äôve talked about so far.

So this is hard to explain - have you ever tasted olive oil and thought this tastes too much like olives? Yeah, that‚Äôs a cheap olive oil.  Sorry, just because it‚Äôs $40 doesn‚Äôt make it good.  What I‚Äôm trying to say is that good quality, small batch olive oil like [Grove 45](https://farm2.me/products/grove-45-extra-virgin-olive-oil-6-bottles-500-ml) in CA or [1836 Texas Olive Oil](https://farm2.me/collections/1836-a-texas-olive-oil-company-wholesale-wholesale) in TX could be poured like a shot and you can drizzle some honey and lemon in it and it would taste like something spectacular!  That‚Äôs olive oil.  And that‚Äôs all you need, a little drizzle on your pizza or salad, it will last years on your counter, and you‚Äôll thank us!  Your customers (if you‚Äôre running a store or restaurant) will be back again - and no store will be able to beat you. 

Let‚Äôs start with flavor intensity. As you can imagine by now, high intensity means you‚Äôll taste a lot more of the oil in your dishes. It‚Äôs not inherently good or bad, since it depends on the quality of the taste (paragraph before this) and what you like or the dish you‚Äôre using it for. High intensity great tasting olive oil works for drizzling over salads, grilled vegetables, and dishes where a strong olive oil presence is a good thing, or taking a shot. For more subtle dishes, you might want to go for an oil with lower intensity.

Next, there‚Äôs acidity level. For this one, there is a good and a bad and lower is better. Acidity in this case is talking about the relative amount of free fatty acids in the oil, since these fatty acids are what we‚Äôre talking about when we say there are ‚Äúhealthy fats‚Äù in olive oil. In poor quality olive oil, more of the fatty acids have been broken down.  This is the equivalent of health benefit ‚Äî sorry grocery store Olive Oil.  Yes, even Whole Foods, Trader Joes, Faire, etc.

Then there‚Äôs polyphenol count and antioxidants. Polyphenols are a by product of photosynthesis in plants that are known to be antioxidants, meaning they reduce the risk of heart disease and a long list of other diseases by neutralizing free radicals in the body. A high-polyphenol count is a good thing.

## What Does Cold-Pressed Olive Really Mean?

The _[cold-pressed label](https://www.aboutoliveoil.org/glossary-of-olive-oil-terminology-0)_ means the oil was mechanically extracted from the olives at temperatures that don‚Äôt rise above 80.6 F. Low heat means the oil stays unaltered and remains high quality. Think machines going up and down really fast creating heat, or grinders working like an engine. Not good! 

### The Origin of the Term

Modern olive oil extraction doesn‚Äôt look like the process from hundreds of years ago. Back then, olives were crushed by stones and the mushy goodness was then spread on mats. Here, the olive water and oil would be separated through a manual pressing process.¬†

Machinery has since developed and most ‚Äúpressing‚Äù is done with technology like the centrifuge, a high-speed spinning device that separates liquids based on their density. Think of it like being in the Disneyland teacup ride at 10x speed where the ‚Äúolive water‚Äù teacups fly to one corner and the ‚Äúoil‚Äù ones glide to the opposite side.  You don‚Äôt want that!

So think no mass production ‚Äî no mass production regions in Spain like Jaen, Spain. Graza olive oil (which never called Farm2Me back to be transparent about their olive oil production ‚Äî since 2021) Graza is made in Jaen, Spain, a region that produces more than half of the world‚Äôs olive oil.  So yes, Graza promises a high quality at low $20 price point, but it‚Äôs actually not ü§Æ. Ask yourself how they can make enough Olive Oil to sell 10s of cases to every grocery store in the country, if it‚Äôs high quality? 

Save your money , and refill that bottle with Bartoli or some other crap.  If you want something to drizzle or sizzle - go with [another olive oil](https://farm2.me/collections/olive-oil-wholesale) or [learn about them on Farm2Me](https://farm2.me/collections/olive-oil-wholesale).

### First Pressed

So how is cold pressed different from first pressed? The first ‚Äúpressed‚Äù label also refers to the old method of extraction. Olives would be pressed multiple times to get as much oil as possible. The first press was considered the best quality while any subsequent pressings were seen as ‚Äúinferior‚Äù oil.¬†

Because this term applies to the first batch of extraction, this also means the olives are pressed while cold. So an olive oil labeled as the first press is almost always cold-pressed.

### EVOO

Now, let‚Äôs discuss how these labels apply to extra virgin olive oil. By definition, and based on international oil regulations, olive oil can only earn the title of ‚Äúvirgin‚Äù or ‚Äúextra virgin‚Äù if it is cold-pressed. This means all extra virgin olive oil, regardless of whether it slaps it on its label or not, is cold-pressed.¬†

For the most part, extra virgin olive oil is always first, cold pressed to achieve the best quality standards. This doesn‚Äôt apply if you buy a bottle with ‚Äúvirgin,‚Äù ‚Äúrefined,‚Äù or ‚Äúblend‚Äù on the label. Those may have been pressed multiple times or with heat and are of a lower quality.

## Health Benefits of Cold-Pressed Olive Oil

The labels might not mean anything, but _[the benefits](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/cold-pressed-olive-oil#11.-May-benefit-hair,-skin,-and-nails)_ of cold-pressed (aka extra virgin) olive oil have evidence to back them up.¬†

EVOO is mostly made up of healthy, unsaturated fats ‚Äì75% by volume‚Äì and packed with antioxidants. Together, these two powerhouses support the immune system, reduce inflammation, and boost brain health. Who doesn‚Äôt want a stronger mind and cleaner body?

There‚Äôs also growing research that cold-pressed, extra virgin olive oils can:

* Promote healthy hair, skin, and nails

* Lower blood sugar levels

* Reduce the development of osteoporosis

* Decrease the likelihood of type 2 diabetes

You can enjoy a similar ratio of unsaturated fats in regular olive oil as well, but _[some experiments](https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/is-extra-virgin-olive-oil-extra-healthy)_ have shown that oils processed with high heat or chemicals contain fewer antioxidants. For the best options, you want to stay away from olive oil blends which have been mixed with other suspicious oils and light olive oil which is ultra processed.

**Decentralization of Big Food**

Big Food is ConAgra (a monopoly of Grocery & Agriculture) and they control nearly 99.5% of the food you eat - regardless of what supermarket  you shop.  

Earlier this month, we explored how lackluster total shareholder returns (TSRs) can force transformational change in Expect Big Change in Big Food. Now we explore some historical context and the corporate strategy megatrend we believe guides board-level decision-making. General Mills and Conagra reported quarterly earnings a few weeks ago. The big takeaway was that consumers remain in a Big Food coma after 2-3 years of multi-decade-high COVID-driven ‚Äúat-home‚Äù consumption growth. Consumers are now pushing back on price increases, and retailers are investing more in their private label programs. Big Food is back to losing market share again following its short-lived outperformance during the pandemic. Predictably, these factors are forcing Big Food companies to promote and advertise more heavily this summer to improve consumer receptivity to their flagship brands ahead of the Back-to-School season.

However, we believe the COVID era will likely prove a temporary distraction from the corporate strategy megatrend that had been guiding these companies‚Äô actions before this black swan event. In the years and decades before the pandemic, most Big Food companies had been hard at work whittling their portfolios into leaner, more agile, mega/category-specific businesses. This ""Great De-Conglomeration"" involved unwinding what corporate conglomeration had done to the food sector 50+ years ago. The conglomerate era of the 1950-1970s favored the creation of large diversified ""holding"" or ""portfolio"" companies, under the theory that owning multiple uncorrelated cash flow streams would generate steadier, more predictable returns for shareholders through economic cycles. However, the increased complexity and management hubris ultimately led to relatively lackluster organic TSRs and value-destructive M&A, prompting a shift towards decentralization.

In Big Food and Big CPG broadly, decentralization remains an ongoing process. General Mills and Conagra offer interesting examples of this trend, having diversified their portfolios extensively before focusing back on core operations. For instance, General Mills divested its toys and fashion units, and in recent years expanded into pet food with acquisitions of Blue Buffalo and others. Conagra shed most of its non-core assets and reoriented towards a brand- and marketing-oriented CPG company. Despite years of simplification, challenges remain, as seen with Conagra's $100 million lawsuit related to lead paint liabilities. The big strategy question for Big Food is where diversification starts and ends now, as managing large portfolios of brands and business units across disparate categories and channels remains complex. This ongoing process highlights the necessity for Big Food to focus on fewer, bigger things to stay competitive in an evolving market.

I‚Äôm not dictating the direction of the movement, I just report on trends that we see emerging before anyone else.  And as of 2020, that‚Äôs seaweed. The beauty of the movement we spearheaded is that it‚Äôs not controlled by investors or grocery buyers  ‚Äî it‚Äôs controlled by the consumers  who vote with our dollars. 

We hope this newsletter gets us all to rethink ‚Äúemerging‚Äù.  We see innovation in our grocery stores, but those products are already 5-10 years old by the time they reach the shelf and have been acquired by Big Ag acquisition or rely on co-packer manufacturers that replace ingredients with crap (think Kellogg‚Äôs, Driscoll‚Äôs ‚ÄúOrganic Strawberries‚Äù, or Siete products).  Those sell out brands are all but doomed: for 1, the replacement of seasonal ingredients with poor ingredients that leads to an artificial taste (compared to actually small batch products ‚Äî go open any jam in a grocery store and do a taste test next to a jam from a farmers market) , and 2nd the inevitability of the truth getting out. (We don‚Äôt report on acquisitions ‚Äî after causing RxBar and Sea2Table to go bankrupt in 2016, we felt guilty for causing 100s of layoffs - but there are 100s of newsletters and Instagram accounts that continue to report on the news).  

The point of Farm2Me is to report on innovation early enough to change the direction of the industry, keep it ahead of the curve, and learn from the changemakers (old and new) so we can help amplify their message to our 400,000 person newsletter and social channels. Plus, supporting local brands is a win for the environment too.  But that‚Äôs a newsletter for 2034.

‚Äã[Wavy Wonders](https://farm2.me/collections/wavy-wonders-wholesale) co-founders - Neil & Thomas - both grew up near water, but Wavy Wonders‚Äô¬†love of seaweed only truly took off in 2020.

**grab your fav snack, we‚Äôre going to the beach**

Exploring farmers markets around the world is my culinary paradise, especially when discovering local delicacies like seaweed. It's a chance to connect directly with the dedicated artisans who grow our food, learning use cases for their varietals, how they came to be, and ways to use it for flavor and nutrition.

Understanding the nuances of seaweed can enhance your culinary adventures. Seaweed, like all food follows the rules of ‚Äúwhat grows together, goes together‚Äù.  Not only is it a nutrient-dense superfood, that offers numerous health benefits, including essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants ‚Äî it‚Äôs what our ancestors would eat when we were floating around the oceans (so ya know some ancient part of you needs it) . It's known to boost immune function, improve gut health, and support thyroid function (natural Iodine).

The types and flavors of seaweed vary across regions. In the Pacific Northwest, you'll find kombu and nori, while the Atlantic coast offers dulse and Irish moss. Exploring local markets can introduce you to these regional varieties, each bringing its unique taste and texture to your dishes.

Cooking with seaweed is versatile and straightforward. Use seaweed in soup (think instant seafood soup or elevated miso soup), nori sheets for sushi rolls, add kombu to l broths for a savory depth (or just for the salt and nutrients), or sprinkle dried dulse flakes on avocado or salads for a nutrient boost. Seaweed can also be incorporated into smoothies, stir-fries, and even baked goods.

No wonder seaweed farms are growing at a rate of 800% in 2024, both for the demand from seaweed snack brands and from consumers looking to buy seaweed as an ingredient.  We know Oyster farms switching to Seaweed! Regardless, embrace your market adventure, try some [snacks](https://farm2.me/search?q=seaweed), put them in your [kids‚Äô lunch box](https://farm2.me/search?q=seaweed), and don't shy away from trying [seaweed](https://farm2.me/search?q=seaweed) in your recipes. Its diverse forms and flavors can transform your culinary creations with new and exciting nutrients. Save your health & the planet.

With culinary regards,

Farm2Me

**[Ark of Taste](https://farm2.me/collections/ark-of-taste-wholesale)** is a living catalog of delicious and distinctive foods facing extinction. By identifying and championing these foods, we keep them in production and on our plates.

Agricultural¬†biodiversity¬†and¬†small‚Äìscale, family-based food production¬†systems¬†are in danger throughout the world due to industrialization, genetic erosion, changing consumption patterns, climate change, the abandonment of rural areas, migration, and conflict.

The **[Ark of Taste](https://farm2.me/collections/ark-of-taste-wholesale)** invites everybody to take action: In some cases, products need to be rediscovered and put back on the table, and producers need to be supported and to have their stories told; in others, such as the case of endangered wild species, it might be better to eat less or none of them in order to preserve them and favor their reproduction.

# **The Hard Work of Bringing Kelp to Market**

**[Civil Eats ](https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/hard-work-bringing-kelp-market)**

_**As seaweed farms develop on both coasts and begin to contribute to America‚Äôs blue economy, much depends on infrastructure.**_

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

It was nearly sunset on a breezy May afternoon when Scott Lord and his wife Sheena pulled into Port Clyde, Maine, on the¬†_Eva Marie._¬†The hull sat low in the water, weighed down by 2,500 pounds of sugar kelp. The Lords had been out on the water since 5 a.m.

‚ÄúAnything you do on a boat is a long day,‚Äù said Scott. Especially if you‚Äôre a kelp farmer, trying to make the most of a short, 12-week season. That day, they‚Äôd been out to their four-acre farm and back twice, harvesting a total of 6,300¬†pounds. The wind had whipped the rubbery, golden-brown kelp fronds across Sheena‚Äôs face as she hand-cut the seaweed from the lines raised up from the water onto the deck.

She and Scott had worked quickly to stuff the kelp ribbons into giant bags. Now those bags were ready to be offloaded into a waiting truck and driven 100 miles southwest to their processor,¬†_[Atlantic Sea Farms](https://atlanticseafarms.com/)_¬†(ASF), near Portland, where many of the state‚Äôs kelp companies are based. Maine is the heart of America‚Äôs farmed seaweed industry, supplying half its harvest‚Äî_[well over a million pounds](https://seaweedhub.extension.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3646/2023/04/2023-State-of-the-States_For-Posting_Dec2023.pdf)_‚Äîlast season.

Largely developed in Asia, seaweed farming is¬†_[a new venture on American shores](https://civileats.com/2024/06/27/overview-promise-and-possible-pitfalls-of-american-kelp-farming/)_. One type in particular, kelp‚Äîa large brown algae with many species, including sugar kelp‚Äî has been hailed as an ecologically beneficial,¬†_[nutritious superfood](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/food-science/edible-seaweed)_¬†that can be farmed on both U.S. coasts‚Äîand¬†_[could help fight climate change](https://civileats.com/2024/06/27/overview-promise-and-possible-pitfalls-of-american-kelp-farming/)_. These remarkable characteristics have helped the seaweed industry attract¬†_[roughly $380 million](https://civileats.com/2024/06/27/overview-promise-and-possible-pitfalls-of-american-kelp-farming/)_¬†in investments since 2018, from government, venture capital, and nonprofits.

However, that‚Äôs a drop in the bucket compared to the¬†_[global $9.9 billion market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/commercial-seaweed-market)_. And, according to farmers and kelp companies, the U.S. investment doesn‚Äôt yet address a range of logistical issues that challenge‚Äîsome might even say threaten‚Äîthe success of seaweed production.

## **A Highly Perishable Food**

Scott Lord became a seaweed farmer five years ago to potentially help his other harvests‚Äîoysters and lobsters‚Äîadapt to¬†_[rising ocean acidification in Maine](https://civileats.com/2024/06/27/can-seaweed-save-american-shellfish/)_; kelp has a remarkable ability to lower the water‚Äôs pH. What he calls ‚Äúkelping‚Äù also gives him an additional income stream.

These natural sugars are generally healthier compared to added sugars found in many processed foods.

However, if you have specific health concerns or conditions like diabetes, it's always best to consult with a medical professional before starting any cleanse or dietary change. They can provide personalized advice based on your health status.

Hi ,

 		 [Lift the Strain] [3] 

Ôªø

The RESTAURANTS CANADA INTELLIGENCE team has been very busy creating tools
and resources to elevate the knowledge and vision of operators across the
country and to help deliver on our mandate of fueling and supporting the
foodservice industry.

 		 [Restaurant Industry at a Glance] [4] 

Research and data have never been more important for businesses, so I am
particularly delighted to announce the launch of the RESTAURANT INDUSTRY
FAST FACTS [4] page on restaurantscanada.org. Scroll, click and test-drive
this national industry dashboard to access comprehensive, segmented data by
region and restaurant category, with comparative views of both YOY/YTD
industry performance. We encourage you to explore these valuable and
diverse insights, which will be updated monthly, and put them to great use!

 		 [Pathways to Careers in Foodservice] [5] 

I am also very thrilled to announce a new and potentially game-changing
Ontario initiative, PATHWAYS TO CAREERS IN FOODSERVICE [5]. Restaurants
Canada has been hard at work on a tailored array of programs designed to
address our industry‚Äôs labour and skills gap and bolster restaurant and
foodservice operations through an array of grants, subsidies and
recruitment support. Funded by the Government of Ontario‚Äôs Skills
Development Fund, this initiative focuses on enhancing workforce
development and promoting the employment of individuals from
under-represented groups.¬†¬†

Restaurants Canada is grateful to the Minister of Labour, Immigration,
Training and Skills Development, the HON. DAVID PICCINI [6], for the
Government of Ontario's significant investment in the foodservice sector.
As the fourth-largest private employer in the province, we employ a diverse
cross-section of the population and serve communities across Ontario. This
support is instrumental in fostering the growth and prosperity our industry
needs to thrive. PLEASE VISIT THE PATHWAYS TO CAREERS IN FOODSERVICE WEB
PAGE HERE [5] FOR MORE INFORMATION.¬†

I‚Äôd like to introduce DONALD GUSE SALAH [7], our dedicated Project
Director, who will be your main point of contact for this program. With his
extensive expertise in workforce development, Donald is dedicated to
helping you navigate through and fully benefit from this initiative. He is
ready to address any questions, offer personalized support, and ensure your
success. You can reach Donald directly at DSALAH@RESTAURANTSCANADA.ORG.¬†

The 2024 CALGARY STAMPEDE closed yesterday. I would like to acknowledge the
significance of the Stampede and similar events across the country for
their incredible contributions to both the provincial and national economy
and the crucial role they play in bringing people together. This iconic
event is not only a vital driver of tourism, attracting over a million
visitors each year, but also serves as a key touchpoint that strengthens
the hospitality industry, generating an estimated $282 million in economic
activity during its ten-day run. Of this amount, approximately $227 million
directly benefits the City of Calgary. The Calgary Stampede's rich
tradition and vibrant celebrations create a welcoming environment that
benefits countless businesses and highlights the cultural and economic
vitality of our foodservice community. We extend our gratitude to all those
who make this event a success year after year and for hosting such an
important tourism offering.¬†
¬†
BACK IN ONTARIO, Restaurants Canada continues to tirelessly highlight the
significant impact of the LCBO STRIKE on the foodservice industry,
emphasizing that this disruption comes at a particularly challenging time.
The industry has already weathered a series of extraordinary and successive
headwinds, including the prolonged effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply
chain disruptions, and rising operational costs. The LCBO strike
exacerbates these challenges by constraining the availability of key
products. ¬†
¬†
As highlighted on Friday to our Ontario members, we are now into the second
week of the LCBO strike which has significantly impacted the industry‚Äôs
14,000+ licensed operators. IF YOU HAVEN'T YET COMPLETED THE LCBO IMPACT
SURVEY [8], I urge you to do so immediately. Your participation is crucial
for our advocacy efforts.¬†

 		 [LCBO Impact Survey] [8] 

Since the start of the strike, we have been grateful for your ongoing
communication regarding your experiences and forecasts. Your calls, emails,
and survey responses have provided us with crucial insights that enable us
to advocate effectively on your behalf. Thank you.¬†

Late last week, I had a discussion with Premier Ford and Minister
Bethlenfalvy to relay the concerns you've shared with us. Restaurants
Canada‚Äôs VP Central, Kris Barnier and I have maintained close contact
with both the government and LCBO over the weekend, and our team will
remain engaged with them throughout the strike.¬†Our message to them has
been clear.¬†
¬†
While we cannot, yet, fully quantify the impact of the union's efforts to
disrupt LCBO services or other factors, we have emphasized to them that the
current contingency plan is not working and that your businesses are not
able to find available inventory for most products listed.‚ÄØ ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ¬†
¬†
We underscored the critical role of alcohol sales (via LCBO products) to
your businesses and highlighted the potential consequences if a
satisfactory resolution is not reached promptly.¬†
¬†
Additionally, we made it clear that although we understand the current
situation is far from normal‚ÄØand that it will continue to NOT be
business-as-usual, it is essential‚ÄØthat they make it their highest
priority to support‚ÄØrestaurants and bars with the limited resources
available to them.¬†
¬†
I am grateful to Premier Ford and Minister Bethlenfalvy for listening to
our concerns and acknowledging the importance of prioritizing our sector.
Although operations are disrupted, it is evident that both the LCBO and the
Government of Ontario are actively seeking solutions to address the
challenges affecting our access to products. We will continue to monitor
the situation closely and maintain ongoing communication with our members
to promptly address any significant issues arising as the industry adapts
to revised LCBO service plans.¬†

As we advocate on your behalf, it is critical that we are armed with
information that spells out exactly how the strike is impacting your
business and what you forecast if the strike continues to drag on. That is
why we are asking you to please complete the IMPACT SURVEY [8]. I cannot
emphasize enough the importance of the survey information for our
discussions. If you oversee multiple operations, please distribute the
survey to ensure we gather comprehensive feedback. There is strength in
numbers, and we are collaborating with other organizations to assess the
strike's broader impact on sectors reliant on the LCBO.¬†

NATIONAL: FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ISSUES CONSULTATION DOCUMENT FOR TEXTILE &
APPAREL SECTOR WASTE WITH POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RESTAURANT SECTOR

The Federal Environment Minister, Steven Guilbeault, published
a‚ÄØCONSULTATION DOCUMENT [14]‚ÄØon the development of a roadmap to address
plastic waste and pollution from the textile and apparel sector. The
proposed environmental objective is‚ÄØ‚Äú‚Ä¶to prevent textile and apparel
waste (including microfibres) from going to landfill or incineration or
leaking into the environment as pollution‚Äù with a focus on redesign,
reduce, reuse, repair and recycling of products over energy recovery and
landfilling.¬†¬†
¬†
Restaurants are referenced in the discussion questions, including a
question on collection of textile waste data. Restaurants Canada is
reviewing the consultation and monitoring for further information to
determine how we will engage in this process and will keep you informed
along the way.

TORONTO: CITY ANNOUNCES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CIRCULAR ECONOMY ROADMAP

The City of Toronto announced it is developing a circular economy roadmap,
including a 10-year strategy to make Toronto the first ""circular city"" in
Ontario. As part of the lead up to this, the City conducted a‚ÄØBASELINE
CIRCULARITY STUDY [15]‚ÄØ(published in 2022) which identified three sectors
as having the greatest potential for circular economy impact: waste
management, construction and the food system. RC is developing an
engagement approach to ensure the foodservice industry is a voice at the
table as this strategy is developed.

PEI: DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE DEVELOPING STRATEGY TO ADDRESS FOOD WASTE &
FOOD INSECURITY 

The PEI Department of Agriculture is developing a‚ÄØFOOD WASTE REDUCTION
STRATEGY [16]‚ÄØto address food waste and food insecurity in the province.
They have launched an initial consultation that closes on August 14, 2024.
As part of Phase 2 of this initial consultation, the province will host
engagement sessions with partners involved in the food supply chain and
foodservice to collect input into the strategy. We will be preparing a
submission for the consultation and are monitoring for additional
announcements on the engagement sessions.

FEDERAL: HEADS UP - POTENTIAL INCREASE IN LMIA APPLICATION FEE 

We‚Äôve learned that the government is currently reviewing the LMIA
application fee, which means the current $1,000 cost is likely to increase
soon. If you are considering adding more temporary foreign workers to your
workforce, we recommend submitting your application promptly to avoid this
probable cost increase.¬†
¬†
It is our hope this fee review will allow the government to hire more
workers and reduce current delays in the processing of LMIA
applications.¬†¬†

FEDERAL: UPCOMING CONSULTATION THIS FALL REGARDING MARKETING TO CHILDREN 

Health Canada is set to launch a consultation this fall regarding marketing
to children, aiming to introduce regulatory changes by 2025 (possibly in
the spring, but more likely in the fall of 2025). It is anticipated that
in-restaurant advertising and broadcasting will be key areas of focus,
potentially affecting how menu items can be promoted.¬†
¬†
We have established monthly meetings with the Minister's office to discuss
this topic and will prepare a submission for the consultation once it
begins. Stay tuned for more information.¬†

NEW RAISE THE BAR REPORT IN THE WORKS AS RESTAURANTS CANADA WORKS TO
MODERNIZE BEVERAGE ALCOHOL REGULATIONS

While the Ontario LCBO strike has been drawing a great deal of national
media attention, Restaurants Canada is continuing its work to modernize
beverage alcohol regulations across the country.¬†

Work has begun on a new‚ÄØ_RAISE THE BAR_‚ÄØreport, our biennial
examination of how provincial governments manage beverage alcohol sales
across the country, with its release planned for late 2024. A new
methodology is being developed to best reflect how well each province
regulates licensing, retail sales, wholesaling and distribution, and what
steps are being taken to modernize how beverage alcohol is regulated.¬†
¬†
I have been consulting with provincial finance managers and the senior
management of the provincial retail monopolies in Atlantic Canada to gather
information and advocate for better beverage alcohol frameworks.¬†
¬†
To support this work, over the past month, I have met with the finance
minister of New Brunswick, ERNIE STEEVES [17], Newfoundland and
Labrador‚Äôs finance minister SIOBHAN COADY [18], and Newfoundland Labrador
Liquor Corporation COO WALLY DICKS [19], and have most recently met with
the CEO of the PEI Liquor Control Commission DANNY MACDONALD [20] and PEI
finance minister JILL BURRIDGE [21]. The purpose of these meetings is to
enhance Restaurants Canada‚Äôs understanding of the provinces‚Äô plans and
intent to modernize their systems to meet the needs of a 21st‚ÄØcentury
marketplace and to provide input from our industry.¬†¬†
¬†
A meeting with the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation CEO Greg Hughes is
planned for August, and Restaurants Canada will be consulting with other
governments and industry stakeholders in the months ahead.‚ÄØ¬†

ATLANTIC: HITTING THE ROAD & THE AIRWAVES

I have also made multiple appearances on regional media as the summer
season gets underway, with interviews with the Todd Veinotte Show on
CityNews 95.7 in Nova Scotia, Tim Powers on VOCM in Newfoundland and
Labrador, Tara Clow on Acadia Broadcasting in New Brunswick, and CBC Radio
and digital on Prince Edward Island. Topics have included Restaurant
Canada‚Äôs campaign to encourage the federal government to Lift the Strain
on small business with EI and CPP relief, the state of the summer tourism
industry, and the impact of ‚Äúdine and dash‚Äù incidents.

ONTARIO: RESTAURANTS CANADA HIGHLIGHTS IMPACT ON RESTAURANTS AS LCBO STRIKE
CARRIES ON

 		 [Ontario: Restaurants Canada Highlights Impact on Restaurants as LCBO
Strike Carries On] [8] 

Restaurants Canada remains in constant and close contact with senior
representatives from the Government of Ontario and the LCBO. Through both
media and direct conversations, we are communicating to government, the
LCBO, and the public the scope of the challenges and frustrations the
strike is causing for your business.¬†¬†
¬†
During the lead up and throughout the strike to date, we have continued to
advocate for a contingency plan that is responsive to the needs of
restaurant and bar owners. While there has been responsiveness related to
online ordering processes, we have relayed the challenges you are facing
with finding available inventory on the LCBO website. We are also ensuring
that the government understands the risks to your business if the strike
persists for an extended period, calling on the province to ensure their
top priority is to flow products to bars and restaurants to protect your
businesses and the wellbeing of those who depend on your operation for
their livelihoods. ¬†¬†
¬†
To support our discussions with the LCBO and key government officials, we
have prepared a survey to help us represent the impact of the strike on
your businesses. Your input is incredibly valuable to our discussions.
PLEASE TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO FILL OUT THE IMPACT OF LCBO STRIKE SURVEY

Restaurants Canada will continue to communicate with you and on your behalf

BC: SINGLE-USE & PLASTIC WASTE PREVENTION REGULATION

On July 15th, BC members are reminded that Parts 2 and 3 and Section 11 of

shopping bags, food service ware, and oxo-degradable plastics will be
implemented.¬†¬†
¬†
Most provisions of the regulation were implemented on December 20, 2023;
however, the regulation provided industry with an additional six months to
prepare for the implementation of these regulation provisions. Effective
July 15th, members will be required to charge guests a $.25 fee for paper
bags larger than 5cm by 20cm and a $2.00 fee for reusable bags. Using food
ware made with hard-to-recycle plastics such as Styrofoam and packaging
made with oxo-degradable plastics will also be prohibited. For more
information, please reference the regulation implementation INFO SHEET

 		¬†

Hi ,

I understand that the LCBO strike poses a significant challenge for your
business. That's why Kris Barnier, our Vice President for Central Canada,
and I have been dedicated to advocating on your behalf.¬†

On Thursday evening, I spoke with Finance Minister Bethlenfalvy and Premier
Ford. They listened as I shared your challenges and frustrations. I remain
hopeful that the strike will end soon, but we must understand that the
Government remains committed to staying on its current path with alcohol
moderation and while we will continue to monitor developments, the union
has signaled that it has a healthy strike fund.¬†

We will maintain ongoing communication with LCBO and the government to
update them on your issues and concerns. Additionally, we will discuss
their contingency plans to safeguard product availability and ensure orders
are fulfilled for restaurants and bars. We are working to ensure we are
prioritized. ¬†

We cannot know the level of impact it is having on retail and/or wholesale
customers, but we do know that the union has made clear in its statements
that it is working to disrupt LCBO operations. ¬†¬†

As we go forward, it is important that we are in the best position to help
LCBO, the government, and other key stakeholders UNDERSTAND YOUR SPECIFIC
CHALLENGES and their impact on your business. THAT IS WHY WE CONTINUE TO
WELCOME YOUR CALLS AND EMAILS.¬†IT IS ALSO WHY WE ARE ASKING YOU TO
COMPLETE THIS SURVEY [3]. It will provide us with critically important
information that will help us continue to advocate on your behalf. If you
oversee multiple operations, please distribute the survey to ensure we
gather comprehensive feedback. THERE IS STRENGTH IN NUMBERS, and we are
collaborating with other organizations to assess the strike's broader
impact on sectors reliant on the LCBO.¬†

My best,
Kelly

Invitation from Bladder Cancer Canada to partner for National Lemonade Day and offer a $5000 donation match.,8,2024-07-08 0:00,1,"Greetings!



As the National Administration Manager for Bladder Cancer Canada, I am thrilled to invite you to turn lemons into lemonade this August.



August 20th is National Lemonade Day, and throughout the month of August we are asking Canadians to host a lemonade stand<https://bladdercancercanada.org/en/national-lemonade-day/> and raise funds to support bladder cancer patients and their loved ones.



As the first and only patient advocacy organization in Canada dedicated to bladder cancer, our mission is to support the 80,000+ Canadians living with this disease, raise awareness, and fund innovative life-saving research. We rely on the generosity of businesses to support our initiatives so that we can one day create a world where bladder cancer is just a memory.



With Well's interest in community, health and entrepreneurship, we would love to collaborate with you on this new and exciting initiative. Would Well be interested in partnering and offering a $5000 donation match to encourage participation?



I look forward to hearing back from you and discussing the benefits of this partnership.



Warm regards,

Eva Jedynak is seeking sponsorship opportunities for the Richmond Hill u19AA team from Well Juicery.,8,2024-09-09 19:27,1,"Hi there,

I hope you are having a wonderful day.  I am reaching out to today as we are looking for amazing business partners who would be  interested in sponsoring our team for the season.  If you are interested in partnering for promotional purposes either through product or monetary donations please let me know. We would be very interested.

A bit about us, we are the Richmond Hill u19AA team.  Sponsorship allows us to develop young athletes, support the development of confident goalies, supply equipment at reduced or no cost and keep our registration costs low so that this amazing sport is accessible to everyone in the community.

This year our team consists of players from Richmond Hill, Markham, Vaughan, Newmarket, Barrie, Uxbridge, Oshawa and Toronto.  We travel all across Ontario and also Quebec competing during our regular season.

Through the generous support of sponsors like you, last year most of our players had been selected by Ringette Ontario to participate in AAA program and compete at Ontario Winter Games.  As well, several have been chosen by team Canada to participate in their development program, a stepping stone to play for team Canada on the international stage.  They met top level players across Canada that they still keep in contact with.  Ringette is an amazing sport with a tight knit community.

The girls are ready to work hard and hope this year will be just as successful.

If you have any questions about the attached  sponsorship details, our amazing sport or to discuss the benefits of youth sports, please contact me.

We‚Äôd like to thank you in advance for your consideration in support of the Richmond Hill Ringette Association, our athletes and families.

Looking forward to hearing from you.  Thank you for your consideration.
","We appreciate you considering Well Juicery for a sponsorship opportunity. Your team's dedication to developing young athletes and making sports accessible is truly commendable.

In a big city called New York, there is a special farm where people grow plants and vegetables together. This farm helps everyone in the neighborhood by giving them fresh food to eat and a fun place to learn about gardening. The people who work on the farm come from many different places (they‚Äôre immigrants, some from the poorest parts of the world) and work together like a big family.

The farm also teaches kids and adults how to grow their own food and take care of the environment. They have special classes where you can learn how to plant seeds, water plants, and pick the vegetables when they are ready. This makes everyone feel happy and proud of what they grow.

Working on the farm helps people make new friends and learn from each other. It's a place where everyone can share their knowledge and help each other, making the whole community stronger and healthier. This neighborhood is also the most dangerous neighborhood in New York City ‚Äî and the farm, [East Brooklyn Farm](https://blog.farm2.me/east-new-york-farms-is-revitalizing-east-new-york/) in East New York, NYC is showing us a model that can help clean up economically abandoned areas and revitalize them.

**What is a ‚ÄúForever Chemical‚Äù**

Imagine if you had a crayon that never wore out, no matter how much you used it. That's what a ""forever chemical"" is like. These chemicals don't break down easily, so they stay in the environment for a very long time. They're found in things like raincoats, non-stick pans, and even some food packaging to make them last longer and stay clean.

**Where Are They?**

These chemicals can end up in places they shouldn't be, like our food and water. Scientists are finding them more often in things like pesticides, which are used to keep bugs away from crops. This means these forever chemicals can get into the food we eat and the water we drink.

**Why Should We Care?**

It's important to know about these chemicals because they can be bad for our health and the environment. Scientists are working hard to find out how we can stop these chemicals from spreading and how to clean them up so that our planet stays safe and healthy for everyone, including kids like us!

"SAOR Studio invites Well Juicery to participate in the Merry & Bright fundraiser, seeking donations of products for gift bags, raffles, or refreshments.",8,2024-09-27 11:50,1,"Hello Drink Well Team,

I‚Äôm Jen Santos, the event coordinator at SAOR Studio, a movement space on
Toronto‚Äôs west end. We focus on moving the body to shift the mind and
access an open heart space through self-study, body awareness, and
mindfulness. On average, we move over 7,000 women a month.

This December, we will host our 9th annual Merry & Bright fundraiser,
supporting CAMH womenmind‚Ñ¢, a network that addresses gender disparities in
mental health research. Our goal is to raise $20,000 for women‚Äôs mental
well-being initiatives.

The event, which runs from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., will offer 8-10 classes
and a market. Participants contribute $50 for a class pass, with all
proceeds going to our cause. Each attendee receives a gift bag celebrating
female-driven and local businesses, and we‚Äôd love for your brand to be
included.

Your products will reach over 400 members, 6,000 email subscribers and
5,500 social media followers. We‚Äôre seeking items for gift bags, raffle
donations, or refreshments for our event.

Your participation adds significant value to our event, and we would be
honoured to showcase your brand.

Thank you for considering this opportunity.

Best regards,
Jen Santos

We've experienced a demanding first two quarters of 2024, which comes as no
surprise to many of you.¬†Running a restaurant has never been more costly.

The foodservice industry has faced numerous challenges in recent years, but
what stands out in the Q2 Report of 2024 is the one-two punch of weaker
consumer spending coinciding with operating costs reaching an unprecedented
high.¬†¬†

The first half of 2024 has been difficult as the combined impact of fewer
visits and high operating costs are hitting all at once. Traditionally,
this industry operates on slim profit margins, and the record-high cost of
food, insurance, and a decline in discretionary funds in the pockets of
consumers, is causing extraordinary strain.¬†

¬†

That‚Äôs why our focus on advocating for smart policies related to cost
relief measures is crucial, and why we're seeking your support for our
latest campaign and policy proposal to lower EI premiums.

FOLLOW THE STORY: 
 NATIONAL POST | RESTAURANTS CANADA Q2 REPORT: COSTS SOAR, WHILE TRAFFIC
TRAILS OFF [4]

Restaurants Canada launched our¬†LIFT THE STRAIN campaign two weeks ago.¬†

PLEASE TAKE TWO MINUTES TO VISIT LIFT THE STRAIN [5] NOW AND SEND A LETTER
TO YOUR MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT REQUESTING A REDUCTION IN EI PREMIUMS. We've
streamlined the process so that your letter will be automatically directed
to the appropriate MP based on your address. Your support is crucial to
this initiative! MPs need to hear directly from constituents like
you‚Äîbusiness operators who are contributing to their communities and the
Canadian economy‚Äîabout the importance of reducing EI premiums.

As a community, we are one of the largest private employers in Canada,
impacting communities nationwide. By collectively advocating for this
reduction, we can ensure our industry's voice is heard loud and clear in
Ottawa.¬†The campaign is supported by prominent organizations like the
Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian Federation of Independent
Business, along with the Tourism Association of Canada, and highlights the
economic benefits of reducing EI premiums as outlined in PROFESSOR IAN
LEE'S [6]¬†REPORT, ""_ON THE PRECIPICE ‚Äì HELP IS NEEDED. [7]_"" ¬†

Restaurants Canada Regional Vice-Presidents, along with local operators,
are already meeting with MPs to rally support for our cause. Your
participation in sending a letter will strengthen our campaign and increase
the potential to achieve lower costs for our industry. Act now by visiting
LIFT THE STRAIN [5]¬†and sending your letter today.

Let us all acknowledge the influence‚Äîthe power of this sector! If you've
ever wondered about the impact your hard work, dedication, and perseverance
has on your community and the broader economy, know that the foodservice
industry plays a vital role in Canada's social and economic fabric.¬† This
is the reality we will persist in advocating and sharing with all
government levels.

 		 [Lift the Strain - Write your MP Today!] [5] 

CAN YOU TAKE TWO MINUTES TO HELP REDUCE YOUR COSTS TO OPERATE?

Take two minutes to VISIT LIFT THE STRAIN [5] NOW and send a letter to your
MP asking for a reduction in EI premiums.

¬†

We have prepared the letter that will automatically select your MP based on
your address. We just need you to visit LIFT THE STRAIN [5] now.

¬†

WHY YOUR HELP IS NEEDED.

Governments are beset by requests daily from interest groups across this
country. To move our request to the top of the pile, we need to generate
urgency around the issue‚Äîthat is where you come in. MPs must hear from
their constituents about the need for a reduction in EI premiums. Groups
that stay silent or passive don‚Äôt get what they are looking for in this
political climate.

¬†

We are a community of 97,000 restaurants that make up the fourth-largest
private employer in the country, touching almost every community in Canada.
Our numbers represent a tremendous opportunity. Think of the impact our
campaign would have if every member sent a letter. It would be impossible
for government to ignore our industry and your challenges.

¬†

THE CAMPAIGN.

Two weeks ago, we held a PRESS CONFERENCE [6] in Ottawa to release a report
by Professor Ian Lee of Carlton University titled, ‚Äú_On the Precipice ‚Äì
Help is Needed._‚Äù The report outlines the need to reduce EI premiums and
underscore the positive outcomes such a move would have on our industry.
The Canadian Chamber of Commerce, The Canadian Federation of Independent
Business, and the Tourism Industry Association of Canada have all signed on
to the campaign.

¬†

Restaurants Canada‚Äôs Regional VPs, together with local operators, are
setting up meetings with MPs in their ridings to ask them to champion a
reduction in EI premiums on our behalf in Ottawa. The more letters they
receive, the more likely it is for MPs to become champions.¬†

¬†

SEND YOUR LETTER NOW AND LET‚ÄôS LOWER COSTS FOR OUR INDUSTRY. VISIT LIFT
THE STRAIN [5] NOW.

ONTARIO: GUELPH SINGLE-USE BYLAW REVIEW

On June 4th, the City of Guelph¬†reviewed PHASE 2 OF THE CITY'S SINGLE-USE
ITEMS BY-LAW [9]. During the meeting, city council¬†added an amendment that
would require businesses to accept a customer‚Äôs clean, reusable food
container for orders made in-store.¬†Our RC team, alongside two RC members,
met with the Mayor of Guelph, city councillors, and city staff the
following week to discuss the amendment and share the health, safety and
operational implementation considerations associated with this approach.
The vote to pass Phase 2 of the by-law, including the amendment, took place
on June 25th and was passed with the following amendments:

	* Mandatory acceptance of¬†re-usable beverage and food containers at
drive-throughs and/or for delivery has been¬†EXEMPTED.¬†
	* The city is going to launch additional consultations into¬†RE-USABLE
CONTAINERS¬†and will report back before March 1, 2025.

EDMONTON: SHOPPING BAG FEE HIKE IS NOW IN EFFECT

As a reminder to our members operating in Edmonton, the increased fee for
shopping bags took effect on July 1st.

¬†

The fees have increased to $0.25 cents for paper bags, and $2.00 for
reusable bags. This fee increase is part of the city's Single-use Item
Reduction by-law that took effect in 2023. The purpose of bag fees is to
encourage customers to reduce waste by bringing their own bags, while also
helping businesses supplement associated costs. For more resources, the
City of Edmonton has a section on the Single-use Items¬†BUSINESSES AND
EVENTS [10] page¬†that includes new tools developed with the help of
several quick service restaurants.

TORONTO: NEW EMISSIONS BY-LAW IN THE WORKS

The Environment and Climate Division at City of Toronto has been directed
by city council to draft a new by-law that will set emissions standards and
limits for all existing buildings in the city.

¬†

Existing buildings are Toronto‚Äôs largest source of GHG emissions (56 per
cent of total community-wide emissions)‚Äîmainly through natural gas use
for space and water heating.

¬†

RC has been engaged to be part of the special-use buildings advisory group
to consult on areas of the by-law where exceptions may be necessary; for
example, buildings that have unique energy needs. The city is undergoing a
technical analysis, engagement, and consultation process to develop the
by-law until November 2024.

NATIONAL: CANADA‚ÄôS 2030 NATURE STRATEGY RELEASED

At the federal level, MINISTER GUILBEAULT [11] announced the release
of¬†CANADA‚ÄôS 2030¬†NATURE¬†STRATEGY [12]¬†and introduced Bill C-73,
an¬†_Act respecting transparency and accountability in relation to certain
commitments Canada has made under the Convention on Biological Diversity
(the Nature Accountability Bill)._

¬†

The¬†Nature¬†Strategy¬†outlines a path for Canada to achieve its
commitments under the KUNMING-MONTREAL¬†GLOBAL¬†BIODIVERSITY FRAMEWORK [13]
(KMGBF), which was adopted by Canada, alongside 195 other countries, back
in 2022. The¬†Strategy¬†largely adopts the 23 targets ‚Äúas-is‚Äù from the
KMGBF¬†across a range of areas including pollution and biodiversity,
ecosystem restoration, species recovery, etc., with the¬†overall goal of
halting and reversing biodiversity loss. We will continue to monitor
progress on this Bill and will keep you informed as updates become
available.

RESTAURANTS CANADA: MONTHLY POLICY TRACKER NOW AVAILABLE

RC is now sending a monthly policy tracker to keep members informed of
sustainability policy updates across the country (and in key regions
globally). If you are not receiving the tracker emails but would like to be
included, please reach out to me at:¬†JRODAK@RESTAURANTSCANADA.ORG.

NATIONAL: ‚ÄòTIS THE BBQ SEASON - FOR MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT

The House of Commons adjourned for the summer on June 19th, so expect
political leaders to hit the trails during this BBQ season and your Member
of Parliament to be in your riding. And since you master the BBQ like no
one else, we encourage you to reach out to your local MP and share some of
the issues our industry is facing. That‚Äôs right, no rest for the wicked
at Restaurants Canada!

¬†

	* SEND THEM A MESSAGE ON EI PREMIUMS: FILL OUT THIS FORM to send a message
to your Member of Parliament, asking them to support lower EI premiums to
lift the strain on small businesses‚Äîand keep more money in the pockets of
employees. It literally takes a minute to complete and can make a huge
difference in our advocacy efforts.¬†
	* HAVING A HARD TIME FILLING OPEN POSITIONS? SHARE YOUR STORY WITH US: It
always helps to have a genuine situation or personal story to explain to
policymakers how difficult it is to recruit the necessary staff to run a
business. Help us better advocate on your behalf by sharing your experience
with us. Email them to me at: MROY@RESTAURANTSCANADA.ORG.
¬†

Restaurants Canada will be busy this summer, meeting with MPs from all
political parties to discuss lowering EI premiums and asking for a matching
and training program to help reduce labour shortage in our industry.

QUEBEC: PLANNING FOR THE NEW PUBLIC SIGNAGE REQUIREMENTS

Starting June 1, 2025, exterior public signs displaying a registered
non-French mark will also have to be accompanied by French text within the
same visual field, and the French text will have to be ‚Äúmarkedly
predominant‚Äù. Specific guidelines from the OQLF are expected in the
coming weeks, which we will share with you, so stay tuned.

¬†

As you plan for this change, know that the OQLF may grant extensions on a
case-by-case basis. As a general rule of thumb, the OQLF only considers
these extensions for businesses that can demonstrate they‚Äôve been taking
steps toward compliance ahead of June 1st, 2025. Demonstrating a bit of
goodwill often goes a long way.

¬†

Not sure if your new public sign meets the requirements? The OQLF informed
us that businesses can send a draft of the public signage design for the
OQLF to confirm its compliance with the new criteria. You must file a
request using their GENERAL INFORMATION REQUEST FORM [14], or make your
request directly to your OQLF advisor, if you already have one.

ATLANTIC: IMMIGRATION UPDATE

There are many employers in Atlantic Canada foodservice operations
frustrated by the changes to the Provincial Nominee Program in Nova Scotia
and Prince Edward Island. However, these frustrations are not isolated to
those provinces, as immigration logjams and red tape are common issues.

We have been consulting with provincial departments and Immigration,
Refugees and Citizenship Canada to find ways to streamline processes and
develop new resources for foodservice employers dealing with labour issues.
IRCC has a dedicated team in Atlantic Canada, and one of their outreach
officers provided the following information to help respond to questions or
concerns from businesses in our sector:

THE TEAM AT PROMOTION@CIC.GC.CA PROVIDE¬†FREE SUPPORT¬†for employers who
have questions about federal programs. They also have a team dedicated to
supporting inquiries from Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP)-designated
employers, who can answer both AIP and non-AIP related immigration
questions, including being able to verify the case status of their
employees (with the employees‚Äô authorization). The email for those
employers is:¬†IRCC.DSCAIP-PIAMSR.IRCC@CIC.GC.CA.

We are continuing to work on your behalf to find immigration and labour
availability options through government agencies. If you missed it earlier
this month, you can CHECK OUT IRCC‚ÄôS LARGEST VIRTUAL JOB FAIR, THE

NOVA SCOTIA: WORKERS COMPENSATION BOARD (WCB)

I have accepted a role on the Board of the Office of the Employer Advisor
(OEA) in Nova Scotia.

The OEA is set up to help employers navigate the complexities of WCB
claims. WCB is going through a review process under the new CEO, Karen
Adams. Restaurants Canada met with Adams in early May to discuss the impact
of new provisions being adopted around psychological injury in the
workplace.

ATLANTIC: BEVERAGE ALCOHOL

In preparation for the development of the next edition of Restaurants
Canada's¬†_RAISE THE BAR_¬†report on beverage alcohol, I will be meeting
with senior Ministers and officials from the finance departments and liquor
corporations across Atlantic Canada to discuss the potential for
modernizing regulations and reducing costs for licensees.

MANITOBA: LEGISLATURE RISES FOR THE SUMMER

Earlier this month, the Legislature rose for the summer.¬† Among its key
initiatives, the government highlighted some of the efforts it is making to
reduce crime.¬† This includes initiatives that target violent and organized
crimes, and commitments made as part of the budget that aim to tackle
mental health and street crime.¬†

¬†

While there have been some positive developments, we remain focused on
pushing the government to fully deliver on its commitment to deliver grants
to businesses to help them with security costs.¬†

MANITOBA: POLICY DEVELOPMENT 

I am working closely with the MRFA on the development of key asks of the
Government of Manitoba.¬† This includes initiatives targeting public
safety, profitability, alcohol policy, labour/workforce development and
other priorities.¬† We will use the summer to continue our work and to
continue to build our relationships with key elected officials, staffers,
and civil servants.¬†

ONTARIO: LCBO STRIKE RISK LOOMS

LCBO workers could go on strike as early as July 5th.¬† I have been in
touch with LCBO and key senior Ford government officials to stress that our
industry is hurting and needs assurance the government and LCBO will do all
they can to avert a strike, or at least do everything possible to ensure
that a strike results in minimal disruption for Ontario‚Äôs bars and
restaurants.¬†

¬†

We are also communicating with beverage alcohol producers to ask what they
might be able to do to help keep products flowing to your businesses to
ensure you can continue to serve your visitors.

¬†

I will keep you informed as we learn of any new developments, and we will
continue to advocate on your behalf to ensure that the Ford government and
LCBO take all actions possible to mitigate the impact of a strike action on
your business.

¬†

In the meantime, you can follow LCBO updates on the situation HERE [28].

ONTARIO: LEGISLATURE RISES FOR SUMMER AS PREMIER SHUFFLES HIS CABINET

Earlier this month, the Ontario Legislative Assembly rose for the summer.
On the same day, the Premier shuffled his cabinet.

¬†

Most of the key ministers whose responsibilities impact our industry remain
in place. That said, there are a few key ministers who have moved into
roles of interest to our sector:

	* STAN CHO [29] is in as the new Minister of Tourism, Culture and Gaming,
with responsibility for OLG.¬† He is a strong minister who is well
respected by his colleagues.¬† 
	* LISA THOMPSON [30] is now Minister of Rural Affairs. She previously
served as Minister of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs. ROB FLACK [31]
is the new Minister of Farming, Agriculture and Agribusiness, and has a
strong background in agriculture as an owner and operator of Flack Farms.
	* TODD SMITH [32] and STEPHEN LECCE [33] have largely flipped roles, with
Smith taking on Education and Lecce taking Energy and Electrification.¬† ¬†
¬†

ONTARIO: ALCOHOL TRANSFORMATION 

Last month, Premier DOUG FORD [34] and Finance Minister PETER BETHLENFALVY
[35] outlined the path their government will take toward modernizing and
opening alcohol sales in Ontario.

¬†

On wholesale pricing, which is key to our industry, the government RELEASE
[36] identified that, ‚ÄúAn interim wholesale discount of 10 per cent from
the LCBO basic retail price for retailers will apply until 2026. A
post-2026 wholesaler price that is consistent for all retailers will be
determined by a formula that adds taxes, mark-ups, and fees to a
supplier‚Äôs set price. The government will continue to consult with
stakeholders on the new model.‚Äù

¬†

Restaurants Canada has since been in touch with the government and the LCBO
to thank them for committing to this step and to note that it represents a
promising, timely, and important opportunity to help support our industry
and the jobs, tax dollars, economic activity, and other community benefits
it drives.

¬†

Working with our Board of Directors and affected Ontario Government
Relations Committee Members, we have struck a Working Committee that will
inform our policy development and advocacy on this opportunity.

RESTAURANTS CANADA: ONGOING WORK ON PROFITABILITY 

The Regional VPs are working with the Restaurants Canada Board and our
regional GR Committees to identify opportunities to help grow profitability
for your businesses.

¬†

This work will keep us active and engaged with members through the

the alcohol, food, insurance, technology, and other industries to identify
ideas and opportunities to help your businesses grow revenue and cut
expenses.¬†¬†

BC: PROVINCE ANNOUNCES NEW DIGITAL APP DRIVER PROTECTION REGULATIONS

On June 12th, the BC government issued a PRESS RELEASE [39] announcing that
they had finalized regulations to provide additional compensation and
protections for BC app-based ride hailing and delivery drivers.

¬†

Then, on June 17th, ¬†ONLINE PLATFORM WORKER REG OIC 340 [40] and ONLINE
PLATFORM WORKERS REG OIC 341 [41] were passed outlining the new driver
compensation and protection measures. The new regulations establish a new
$20.88/hour minimum wage for these drivers, or 120 per cent of the
province‚Äôs minimum wage ($17.40). This is on top of mileage allowances of
$0.45/km for ride hailing assignments and $0.35/km for delivery drivers, to
compensate them for personal vehicle use. Ride hail and delivery app
employers will also need to provide workers compensation coverage for all
ride hail and delivery driver employees. The new regulations come into
force on September 3rd.

¬†

The new regulations follow months of consultations with Restaurants Canada
and other stakeholders. Restaurants Canada provided our GIG WORKERS
CONSULTATION SUBMISSION [42] last September before enabling legislation was
passed in November 2023.

¬†

Since the passing of the legislation, Restaurants Canada has been consulted
on developing the new regulations. We have reiterated our concerns related
to the cost to consumer and change to the independent contractor business
model as these changes treat drivers as employees rather than private
contractors.

¬†

We continue to voice our concerns on the potential cost increase to
delivery app consumers once the new regulations are implemented given the
reported IMPACT [43] of similar delivery driver regulations recently
implemented in Seattle.

BC: TOURISM MINISTER POPHAM APPOINTED AS HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY CABINET

has been appointed as the B.C. government‚Äôs lead minister to work with

¬†

We have had a good relationship with Minister Popham in the past and look
forward to working with her as the lead minister working with her cabinet
colleagues to implement hospitality industry policy priorities. Both BCRFA
and Restaurants Canada met with Minister Popham in her new role on June
27th to discuss our Associations‚Äô top policy and election platform
priorities.

In closing, I would like to take a moment to thank each of you for
continuing to champion our sector. The work you do every day is about more
than earning a living‚Äîit‚Äôs about providing community spaces for
connecting, creating jobs people depend on, and contributing to economic
growth and circulation by generating wealth that cascades to other

Kiren Sihota from BC is a family farm grower interested in supplying local produce and discussing a potential facility in BC for Well Juicery juices.,4,2024-07-19 0:00,1,"Hello,



My name is Kiren Sihota, and I am family farm grower located in British
Columbia. We have been growing local carrots, beets, potatoes, cabbage,
parsnips and other produce for more than 50 years. We are one of the largest
carrot growers supplying locally grown carrots in the Fraser Valley to all
of Western Canada.



I have recently been introduced to your Be Well juice brand, and absolutely
love the product. I noticed that the current market does not supply to BC,
which is very unfortunate.



If you are interested, I would like to discuss the potential opportunity of
opening a facility in British Columbia for your juice brand, as we would be
able to supply locally grown carrots, beets and other products for your
juices.



We also have a local retail farm market where we supply fresh produce and
would love to carry your juices, but unfortunately cannot at the moment.



The Ag industry is always getting lots of support from government bodies for
innovation in producing, processing and securing the local supply chain. I
would love the opportunity to speak to someone who can discuss the
opportunities for a collaboration with us. Being a carrot producer we are
currently looking to partner with someone to bring fresh carrot juice in our
markets.



Please feel free to contact me.



Thank you and hope to hear back.

Hi ,

Since the start of the strike, we have been grateful for your ongoing
communication regarding your experiences and forecasts. Your calls, emails,
and survey responses have provided us with crucial insights that enable us
to advocate effectively on your behalf. Thank you.¬†
¬†
Late last week, I had a discussion with Premier Ford and Minister
Bethlenfalvy to relay the concerns you've shared with us. Central Canada
VP, Kris Barnier and I have maintained close contact with both the
government and LCBO over the weekend, and our team will remain engaged with
them throughout the strike.¬†
Our message to them has been clear.¬†
¬†
While we cannot, yet, fully quantify the impact of the union's efforts to
disrupt LCBO services or other factors, we have emphasized to them that the
current contingency plan is not working and that your businesses are not
able to find available inventory for most products listed.‚ÄØ ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ¬†
¬†
We underscored the critical role of alcohol sales (via LCBO products) to
your businesses and highlighted the potential consequences if a
satisfactory resolution is not reached promptly.¬†
¬†
Additionally, we made it clear that although we understand the current
situation is far from normal‚ÄØand that it will continue to NOT be
business-as-usual, it is essential‚ÄØthat they make it their highest
priority to support‚ÄØrestaurants and bars with the limited resources
available to them.¬†
¬†
I am grateful to Premier Ford and Minister Bethlenfalvy for listening to
our concerns and acknowledging the importance of prioritizing our sector.
Although operations are disrupted, it is evident that both the LCBO and the
Government of Ontario are actively seeking solutions to address the
challenges affecting our access to products. We will continue to monitor
the situation closely and maintain ongoing communication with our members
to promptly address any significant issues arising as the industry adapts
to revised LCBO service plans.¬†
¬†
Once again, I extend my appreciation to Premier Ford, Minister
Bethlenfalvy, the LCBO, and the dedicated workers who are diligently
working‚ÄØwith limited resources‚ÄØto ensure we have the products needed to
serve our customers effectively.¬†

You should have received a message from the LBCO that explains the new
ordering protocols.‚ÄØFor more details please visit‚ÄØLICENSEE | DOING
BUSINESS WITH LCBO [3]¬†or email¬†LICENSEE@LCBO.COM‚ÄØ¬†

My best,

Customer received an informative email about the transition from Universal Analytics to Google Analytics 4 and details on data export and product integrations.,8,2024-06-26 0:00,1,"Google Analytics

Hello Google Analytics user,

On July 1, 2024, Google Analytics 4 properties will have fully replaced  
Universal Analytics properties, as previously announced  
<https://notifications.google.com/g/p/ANiao5oQw2Htr5r1kDMfUSJTiLAok7EgUpIURpWhcdc52GH0ICHjjE6rFZHsb7L5IXPjTtXXuNiYQ6tONcpYdenCYmSb6uvN72P6WKo82yUi0bkj_VW1bSRrEZL_Rbu8jbZYWhQKtht6N1vzy9li7caGlzQIDOVDvSd9S2NRJaIg5YXaAW1CG8Sn_m5arScOZgRcn1jmLLNuZcD2n80AyvggfIsu7OPoXS7SDJLodkufhqr1BpXbd4sqlomFI7p8lToo3pjVp4Vn6KkUvqtLW0Hv>.  
 From that date, Google will begin turning off all Universal Analytics  
services and Universal Analytics APIs, which means Universal Analytics  
properties will be inaccessible through the Google Analytics front-end and  
APIs. If you haven‚Äôt completely migrated to Google Analytics 4 properties,  
follow the migration guide  
<https://notifications.google.com/g/p/ANiao5rOD6NSFMbRaHoDhtSI_U711cznrKNDS2-eSnpHcjtyJrGGHZs7kaYDwqb5ASffrJk2v-c93aAZ9t9Rx3lKuQshETvOl172ro1nCrfr_mU-WgbvLhx9WnfUYW_x8BzFDKPmHpREe_YEmOHXmVVyAfzfARFDPsg2g09X59EszNZIQMdZ50-onRkC3dmPAibuaknbVzgAFzJ8I3PjfgfOhJRMXLEl0OyYqnkSfmlpn584DB2uc7AOufhZm0GsPXWSkIqKxYtXGeIUCpcWmuFvVL20vmNiL7x7ovq2WmvjddcciglWCeFCu8_xFVhgeooc>  
to start making the switch today.

Exporting your data
To maintain access to data from your Universal Analytics property, you  
should download or export your data now. If this isn‚Äôt done through one of  
the methods provided in the Google Analytics Help Center  
<https://notifications.google.com/g/p/ANiao5oR8qgGG76oZtt2lSrszPRnYUeOiM_nQADzJLDOi6fkaNBUvv-x6YZx3ykfgf0zdcVLG7_IVLk84CAh9WNW62yq_1VvFLExgrV66C9ClhGQAC6rakqpV7IUuS3RZR3WZjFUY5lvrL53EAhD3hedAJM0wJ2K-IjnFUeji3LdIraOQ_yAPkFY9UxhpiASmlStQ35ruLWsiOUxE7YwkkgLUWiu18VPL4YgUju346KiB1-HEYWIislkuwi1hO-B8vx-Eyl9hEPB7p_d4PYPZVrmVQbJhrg_Hk10Uq4FfWhkZml-6eoMIPfO6cDlgUv-tuuIv8WOdOch7q8IIabRsvxrKZNZT7BynsYZbotKy_wPRb3zPqQaXar0wTo3VA-QpvNAzGBlSpv3MkXU-2p_wAeFvpW07ADBBh7GylIRDqVu>,  
your data will be permanently deleted by Google and won‚Äôt be recoverable.  
If you intend to use the BigQuery integration to export historical data  
from your Universal Analytics 360 property, we strongly recommend  
initiating this immediately  
<https://notifications.google.com/g/p/ANiao5qT4dP5NOhQuLv5evzRynDziiytbHhp9QKvTZSk44LxUrwQ0ASQbsg75ZFl0ZU-zYLXotIzTaaCTJCetgAgkRUUOnPnm94VXx6MmH65cEPhXERQ57Rm-zVnvz24powcf_24F-1Q10zVYuiM2FtfhcMESrTJ2XFxVtYMGOZmKdTbBCy8FKbAuewZ7NuB1X-SLGhaRehw4kHooXO32N9hF_zl0_WDwqU20fuG3fhexbA49_aYtj_Xh9c0neCdXbzbihiGeJLfXeCkCrbvC09CtiTDTxDokLm_gW8RSsqzRDShkBSNDVyVyUuNYfg2cpPP>.

Product integrations
Universal Analytics data and settings accessed or used through advertiser,  
publisher or other product integrations will be unavailable when services  
have stopped. For example:
	- Universal Analytics goals and ecommerce transactions will stop measuring  
new conversions, including within linked advertising accounts. This may  
affect ad campaign performance if those conversions are used in combination  
with Smart Bidding.
	- Universal Analytics audience lists will be closed, which may affect ad  
campaign media activation and performance.
	- API requests related to Universal Analytics properties will fail,  
including requests for deletion of Universal Analytics data through the  
User Deletion API. This also means that tools relying on an API, such as  
Looker Studio, will not show any Universal Analytics data.
	- BigQuery export and backfill of historical data from Universal Analytics  
360 properties can only be requested up to and including June 30, 2024.  
Already exported data remains available in BigQuery.
	- Attribution Projects that were part of Attribution (beta) in Google  
Analytics will be deleted.

Sincerely,

The Google Analytics Team

Hi there!

I hope this email finds you well!

I'm Aria, the summer student/intern working with the Arthritis Society Canada. I wanted to reach out regarding a potential donation of product for our upcoming Arthritis Fire Ball Gala

I came across your page and was extremely impressed by your products, and we would love to try them, as well as spread the word about your business in Toronto and across our nationwide network!

Arthritis Society Canada is planning several events to raise money to help make a difference in the lives of the 6 million Canadians living with arthritis. We are dedicated to extinguishing arthritis.‚ÄØ‚ÄØFueled by the trust and support of donors and volunteers, Arthritis Society Canada is fighting the fire of arthritis‚ÄØwith research, advocacy, innovation,‚ÄØinformation,‚ÄØand support. It is Canada‚Äôs largest‚ÄØcharitable‚ÄØfunder of cutting-edge arthritis research, investing more than $220 million in research since its founding in 1948.

Arthritis Society Canada aims every day to put as much money as possible to assist individuals, including thousands of children and youths in Canada, through our community programs, youth summer camps and online resources and webinars. We aim our best every day, especially for children with arthritis, to provide vibrant, joyful and dynamic community programs through fundraising at our events and on our platforms.

Some information on our upcoming event:
Arthritis Fire Ball will be on November 2nd, 2024, with over 700 attendees, will be taking place at the Fairmont Royal York.

An elegant black-tie affair that will include all the festivities that make a charity gala an unforgettable party with a purpose ‚Ä¶ including a gourmet three-course dinner, live & silent auction, live band, dancing, and inspirational stories that celebrate the strength, resiliency, and perseverance of people living with arthritis. This is the perfect event for business development or team building as your guests will be treated to an elegant evening that they won't soon forget. Last year's Arthritis Fire Ball‚Ñ¢ was a night to remember and a glowing success with 700+ guests in attendance.

I would like to ask if would be interested in donating:

  *   750-800 units of product (any kind, small or overage) for our Arthritis Fireball Gift bags


As a gift-in-kind donor, we would like to offer the following recognition:

  *   Promote your company logo on our event websites
  *   Company logo featured in our event programs
  *   Company logo featured on screens on event day looping (at event)
  *   Provide an official gift in kind tax receipt (if and when CRA permits)

Please let me know if you have any questions and we are excited to hear from you!

Best,
Aria

Hi,



I ordered a three day juice cleanse (order #29740) and it shows that it left your facility at 2pm Monday but was not delivered until this afternoon. When I received it, the ice packs had fully melted and the juice was warm. I know the juice is supposed to be stored between 0 and 4C so I am concerned.



Please help,

Thanks



Kristina

Our clients see an average growth anywhere from 3,000 to 10,000 followers per month.
